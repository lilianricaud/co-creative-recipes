A meeting format which is about creating choices for the participants and let the meeting be dynamic. The aim is to follow group energy more than an agenda. Whatever people say is OK and part of the process. People are creative and collaborative. Diverse comments are incorporated until there is a shift or breakthrough where all just know what to do.
