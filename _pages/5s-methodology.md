**5S** is the name of a workplace organization method that uses a list of five [Japanese][1] words: *seiri,* *seiton,* *seiso,* *seiketsu,* and *shitsuke.* [Transliterated][2] into [English][3], they all start with the letter "S". The list describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision-making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work. There are five 5S phases: They can be translated from the Japanese as "sort", "set in order", "shine", "standardize", and "sustain". Other translations are possible. Â
