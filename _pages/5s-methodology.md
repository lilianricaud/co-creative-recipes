<b>5S</b> is the name of a workplace organization method that uses a list of five <a title="Japanese language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language">Japanese</a> words: <i>seiri,</i> <i>seiton,</i> <i>seiso,</i> <i>seiketsu,</i> and <i>shitsuke.</i> <a title="Transliteration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration">Transliterated</a> into <a title="English language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">English</a>, they all start with the letter "S". The list describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision-making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work.

There are five 5S phases: They can be translated from the Japanese as "sort", "set in order", "shine", "standardize", and "sustain". Other translations are possible.
