a simple technique to align and focus as a group. Before the meeting/session starts rub your hands together as if you were cold. Everyone follows and rub their hands together in unison. Someone counts 1, 2, 3 and everyone claps at the same time. This not only bring participants together as a team, but it helps them focus and be on the same wavelength. The same is also done to close the meeting. This format was introduced by an african lady during a permaculture convergence in south africa and helped so much focus the group that is now used by Geoff Lawton in his PDCs.
