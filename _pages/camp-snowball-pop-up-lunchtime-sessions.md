Pop-Up Lunchtime Sessions —These are informal presentations, conversations, or activities that “pop up” depending on what people feel like offering. They are 75 minutes in length and can range from a storytelling module or a Pecha Kucha basics bootcamp, to a causal loop clinic or a “graphic recording 101” module. You might go tend the kitchen garden or visit a nearby art museum. Well received and well attended last year, these modules will vary throughout the week.
