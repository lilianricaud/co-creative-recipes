In Bitcoin, anyone can transfer money into a public bitcoin address, and when you transfer, you can post a message thatâ€™s as public as the transact. Transfering micropayment to a bitcoin account can be used a way to send protest message. After the FBI took down the Silk Road, Reddit users identified an address thought to be belong to the FBI.Within hours of the address being discovered, anonymous protesters started peppering the address with messages accusing the feds of blatant hypocrisy in taking down the Silk Road. Call it a protest by payment.
