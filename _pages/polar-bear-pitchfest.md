Startups pitching from a hole cut through the ice.

The start-ups get to pitch as long as they can in freezing cold water while they are being filmed and broadcast via social media to the widest audiences all over the world. Winter swimming or ice swimming is practiced by about 120,000 people in Finland. It's believed to relieve stress, and leave both mind and body relaxed. Usually a short dip - 30 seconds is considered ideal - in the water is followed by a warm-up session in a sauna.
