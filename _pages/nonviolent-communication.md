<b>Nonviolent Communication</b> (abbreviated <b>NVC</b>, also called <b>Compassionate Communication</b> or <b>Collaborative Communication</b>) is a communication process developed by <a title="Marshall Rosenberg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg">Marshall Rosenberg</a> beginning in the 1960s. NVC often functions as a <a title="Conflict resolution" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_resolution">conflict resolution</a> process. It focuses on three aspects of communication: <i>self-empathy</i> (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), <i><a title="Empathy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy">empathy</a></i> (defined as listening to another with deep compassion), and <i>honest self-expression</i> (defined as expressing oneself authentically in a way that is likely to inspire compassion in others).

Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

Nonviolent Communication can dramatically improve relationships by helping people focus their attention on empathetic understanding of others without compromising their own values. It gives people tools to express their real feelings and needs openly and honestly, yet without blame or criticism. Even in situations of long-standing conflict or hostility, the NVC process can open new doors to compassionate connection and action.

NVC delineates four components of communication. Together they help create the kind of dialogue that can foster resolutions satisfying for everyone without painful compromise or sacrifice:
<blockquote>OBSERVATIONS free of evaluations.

FEELINGS straight from the heart.

NEEDS, VALUES and longings.

REQUESTS expressed clearly in positive action language.</blockquote>
