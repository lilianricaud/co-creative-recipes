<b>5 Whys</b> is an iterative question-asking technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" Each question forms the basis of the next question. The "5" in the name derives from an empirical observation on the number of iterations typically required to resolve the problem.

The technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda and was used within the Toyota Motor Corporation during the evolution of its manufacturing methodologies. In other companies, it appears in other forms. Under Ricardo Semler, Semco practices "three whys" and broadens the practice to cover goal setting and decision making.

Not all problems have a single root cause. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated asking a different sequence of questions each time.

The method provides no hard and fast rules about what lines of questions to explore, or how long to continue the search for additional root causes. Thus, even when the method is closely followed, the outcome still depends upon the knowledge and persistence of the people involved.

<h2><span id="Example" class="mw-headline">Example</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>The vehicle will not start. (the problem)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li><i><b>Why?</b></i> - The battery is dead. (first why)</li>
	<li><i><b>Why?</b></i> - The alternator is not functioning. (second why)</li>
	<li><b><i>Why?</i></b> - The alternator belt has broken. (third why)</li>
	<li><i><b>Why?</b></i> - The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. (fourth why)</li>
	<li><i><b>Why?</b></i> - The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (fifth why, a root cause)</li>
</ol>
The questioning for this example could be taken further to a sixth, seventh, or higher level, but five iterations of asking why is generally sufficient to get to a root cause. The key is to encourage the trouble-shooter to avoid assumptions and logic traps and instead trace the chain of causality in direct increments from the effect through any layers of abstraction to a root cause that still has some connection to the original problem. Note that, in this example, the fifth why suggests a broken process or an alterable behaviour, which is indicative of reaching the root-cause level.

It is interesting to note that the last answer points to a process. This is one of the most important aspects in the 5 Why approach - the <i>real</i> root cause should point toward a process that is not working well or does not exist.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference">[3]</sup> Untrained facilitators will often observe that answers seem to point towards classical answers such as not enough time, not enough investments, or not enough manpower. These answers may be true, but they are out of our control. Therefore, instead of asking the question <b>why?</b>, ask <b>why did the process fail?</b>

A key phrase to keep in mind in any 5 Why exercise is "people do not fail, processes do".

<h2><span id="Criticism" class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h2>
While the 5 Whys is a powerful tool for engineers or technically savvy individuals to help get to the true causes of problems, it has been criticized by Teruyuki Minoura, former managing director of global purchasing for Toyota, as being too basic a tool to analyze <a title="Root cause" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause">root causes</a> to the depth that is needed to ensure that they are fixed. Reasons for this criticism include:
<ul>
	<li>Tendency for investigators to stop at symptoms rather than going on to lower-level root causes.</li>
	<li>Inability to go beyond the investigator's current knowledge - cannot find causes that they do not already know.</li>
	<li>Lack of support to help the investigator ask the right "why" questions.</li>
	<li>Results are not repeatable - different people using 5 Whys come up with different causes for the same problem.</li>
	<li>Tendency to isolate a single root cause, whereas each question could elicit many different root causes.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: <em>It could be interesting to transform these potential problems in opportunities. For example, if results are not repeatable, and different people using it come up with different cause and use this as a way to get a better understanding of the problem, possibly by having different 5 why happening in parrallel, some with facilitators or not.</em>
