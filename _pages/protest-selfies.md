Selfies, photographed self-portraits, have exploded with the growth of social media. In 2013, Oxford Dictionaries named the term the Word of the Year. Hashtag activism, which gained momentum during the Occupy Wall Street movement, has also been on the rise with several recent campaigns.

The combination of the two brings selfies beyond narcissistic tendencies.

A selfie with a sign immediately personalizes a campaign and also shows a strong commitment from individuals. Posting a photo of yourself with a message makes a bigger statement than simply tweeting a hashtag or anonymously signing an online petition.

Protest selfies is an intersting way to combine large scale tactics with personnalized self expression and recommandations, aligning collective and personal interest.
