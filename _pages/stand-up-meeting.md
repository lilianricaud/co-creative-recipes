A stand-up meeting (or simply "stand-up") is a daily team-meeting held to provide a status update to the team members in Agile software development processes. The "semi-real-time" status allows participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult and/or time-consuming issues. The term "stand-up" derives from the practise of having the attendees stand at the meeting, as the discomfort of standing for long periods helps to keep the meetings short.
