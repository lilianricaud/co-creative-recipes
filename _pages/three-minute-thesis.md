The Three Minute Thesis is a research communication competition developed by The University of Queensland.  The exercise develops academic, presentation, and research communication skills and supports the development of research students' capacity to effectively explain their research in three minutes in a language appropriate to a non-specialist audience.

One particularity of this lightning talk format is that speakers <strong>can only use one slide</strong> to illustrate their talk.

Note: Although the name is copyrighted, the handbook is freely available (but not under free licence). A french clone exists: Ma thèse en 180 secondes
