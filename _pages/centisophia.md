Centisophia is a follow up event for Centifolia. If Centifolia, was more about talking, Centisophia is about doing. Centifolia had open doors for everyone, Centisophia will require candidates to apply for their participation to attract motivated people and make sure that everyone has a clear understanding about the objectives of the event.
