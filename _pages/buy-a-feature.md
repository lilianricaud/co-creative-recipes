A serious game design to help designers and clients to make better decision about which features to develop. Clients are given a certain amont of "money" that they can spend individually or pool to buy features. By engaging customers as a group and giving them a limited amount of resources, you give them the opportunity to prioritize their desires as a group. But thatâ€™s not where the magic lies. The magic lies in structuring the conversations so that your customers are negotiating with each other for specific features. It is this negotiation that enhances your understanding of what your customers really want.
