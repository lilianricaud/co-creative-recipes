A <strong>Gratiferia</strong> or Really Really Free Market  is a community gathering where participants give away usable items, skills, food, entertainment, games and many others things that a community can come together and share.<!--more-->

An <strong>Gratiferia</strong> is a 100 percent free and non-commercial event (no bartering or advertising), created by all the participants that show up each month. It is also a demonstrate of collective spirit, abundance, recycling, and share through the give economy as an alternative to a capitalist economy that promotes and feeds off fear, competition and scarcity.
