PechaKucha or Pecha Kucha is a presentation methodology in which 20 slides are shown for 20 seconds each (six minutes and 40 seconds in total). The images advance automatically and you talk along to the images. The format, which keeps presentations concise and fast-paced, powers multiple-speaker events called PechaKuchaNights (PKNs) or Pecha Kucha Nights.

Creators found that by restricting presentations in this way they unleashed previously untapped creativity – and the events became enormously popular.
