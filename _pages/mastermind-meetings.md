A mastermind group is a collection of 4-8 creative individuals who meet on a regular basis to help one another reach their fullest potential. Whether directly or indirectly, this group pushes each member to create their best possible work. To get a mastermind group together, you’ll have to find 3-7 other people who will be as committed and dependable as you. They’ll need to be creative, which simply means they’re dedicated to achieving their dreams (and yours) through creative solve, goal setting, and accountability. Finally, everyone in the group needs to be willing to meet on a regular basis. There are many formats that can work for these meetings, so you’ll have to try different things out, keep what you like, and discard what you don’t. However it is very important the meetings are held regularly and at consistant times that works for each person in the group.
