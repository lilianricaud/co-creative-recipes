Software Freedom Day is a worldwide celebration and promotion of free software, open source software and related technologies. The goal of this day is to educate the worldwide public about about good quality free and open source software (FOSS) in education, at the government and in business. Teams of volunteers organise every year worldwide in their local area activities to educate the public about these technologies.
