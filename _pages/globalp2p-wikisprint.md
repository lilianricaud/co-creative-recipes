a globally distributedÂ 24h <a title="WikiSprint" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/wikisprint/">Wikisprint</a> event that aims to map experiences happening around the commons and peer-to-peer.

The first event took place worldwideworld (mostly in Latin America and Southern Europe).

In just one day, 235 projects were mapped in the P2P Foundation wiki. And most importantly: as projects connected, new ones were born. In the upper-left corner, we can see how concepts intermingled, in spite of the normal tendency towards inbreeding. At 13:00 (GMT+1), free and open culture, government, network, and people were discussed. At the bottom left, you can see the accounts talking with one another, showing high rates of transnationality, regardless of borders.
