<i><b>Chavrusa</b></i>,  is a traditional rabbinic approach to Talmudic study in which a pair of students analyze, discuss, and debate a shared text.

Unlike a teacher-student relationship, in which the student memorizes and repeats the material back in tests, <i>chavrusa</i>-style learning puts each student in the position of analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.
