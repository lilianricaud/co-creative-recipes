***The aim of Free/Libre recipes is to become a “source code” for social innovation and to provide enough tools and “ingredients” to allow social practices to be copied, reused and improved.<!--more-->*** In software, the source code tells the machine how to run the program. In 

[Open Social Innovation][1], free/libre recipes provide a documentation to tell people and groups how to reproduce a social practice. <p dir="ltr">
  In practice this is not a simple thing. There are difficulties in documenting social practices and make them spread elsewhere. Notions of subjectivity and cultural context matters.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
   How can we provide a recipe that encompass both some objectives and subjectives aspect of the practice.  We could try to have cold & warm knowledge, descriptive &storytelling, text & multimedia... There is still debate about what should be documented into a recipe (<a href="http://anim-fr.org/RecetteLibres">See the work of the French Network working on free/libre recipes</a>).
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  These questions are still open and are likely to evolve over time. Right now we are trying to collect documentation on practices and if possible find a free/libre version that allow any reuse.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  This recipe can be in any format (web page, PDF, google doc, ...).
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  In addition to this recipe, we are trying try to transfer some recipes on GitHub as a way to foster sharing and improvement of the recipes using <a title="Stigmergic Collaboration" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/stigmergic-collaboration/">Stigmergic Collaboration</a>.
