<em><strong>The aim of Free/Libre recipes is to become a “source code” for social innovation and to provide enough tools and “ingredients” to allow social practices to be copied, reused and improved.<!--more--></strong></em>

In software, the source code tells the machine how to run the program. In <a title="Open Social Innovation" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/open-social-innovation/">Open Social Innovation</a>, free/libre recipes provide a documentation to tell people and groups how to reproduce a social practice.
<p dir="ltr">In practice this is not a simple thing. There are difficulties in documenting social practices and make them spread elsewhere. Notions of subjectivity and cultural context matters.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> How can we provide a recipe that encompass both some objectives and subjectives aspect of the practice.  We could try to have cold &amp; warm knowledge, descriptive &amp;storytelling, text &amp; multimedia... There is still debate about what should be documented into a recipe (<a href="http://anim-fr.org/RecetteLibres">See the work of the French Network working on free/libre recipes</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">These questions are still open and are likely to evolve over time. Right now we are trying to collect documentation on practices and if possible find a free/libre version that allow any reuse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This recipe can be in any format (web page, PDF, google doc, ...).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to this recipe, we are trying try to transfer some recipes on GitHub as a way to foster sharing and improvement of the recipes using <a title="Stigmergic Collaboration" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/stigmergic-collaboration/">Stigmergic Collaboration</a>.</p>
