An open mic (or open mike) is a live show where audience members may perform at the microphone. Usually, the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or master of ceremonies. These events are typically focused on performance arts like poetry and the spoken word, music, and comedy. These shows provide an opportunity for artists to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal shows, which is very difficult to do without experience of live performance
