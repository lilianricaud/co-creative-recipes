The <b>spiral dance</b>, also called the <b>grapevine dance</b> and the <b>weaver’s dance</b>, is a Neopagan group dance emphasizing community and rebirth, although it is also used as an effective way to raise power in a ritual. Although it originated in the Reclaiming tradition, it has become a more mainstream Neopagan ritual which is especially popular at festivals due to its accommodation of large numbers of people.

The spiral dance usually involves a drumming group and a chant or song in addition to the dancers. All members present hold hands and follow a leader in a counter-clockwise motion using a grapevine step. As the leader comes near closing the circle, he or she whips around and begins moving clockwise while facing the rest of the dancers. By continuing this formation, <strong>every dancer in the line will eventually be face to face with every other dancer</strong>.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_dance#cite_note-4">
