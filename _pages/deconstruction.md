The Deconstruction is about re-thinking the world as we know it, taking it apart, making a few adjustments, then putting it back together a little awesomer-er.  It’s a light-hearted competition/ game, but it’s really more of a large-scale collaboration between friends, teams, and the public. The concept is to make the world a slightly better, more play, and more interesting place over 48 hours. The event is open to anyone, anywhere, of any age and skill level.
