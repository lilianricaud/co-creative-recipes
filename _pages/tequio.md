Tequio is a very popular type of work for collective benefit in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapotec_civilization" target="_blank">Zapotec culture</a>. Community members contribute materials or labor to carry out construction work for the community. This could take the form of a school, a well, or a road. An individual can never be the sole beneficiary of tequio. It has a touch of crowdsourcing, a little crowdfunding and a lot of commons built into it. Tequio is still practiced in some Mexican States. In the State of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaxaca" target="_blank">Oaxaca</a>, tequio is protected by state law. There are other terms for similar practices such as “gozona”, or, “a mano vuelta” (changed hands) labor.
