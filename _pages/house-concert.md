A house concert or home concert is a musical concert or performance art that is presented in someone's home or apartment, or a nearby small private space such as a barn, apartment rec room, lawn, or back yard. Common in the historical past, but now unusual in the age of large concert arenas, a house concert is almost invariably described as an "intimate" experience.
