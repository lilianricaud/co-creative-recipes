The Pro act Café is a space for creative and act oriented conversation where participants are invited to bring their call -­‐ project -­‐ ideas -­‐ questions or whatever they feel called by and need help to manifest in the world.

The concept of Pro act Café is a blend of 'World Café' and 'OpenSpace' technologies.

It was first conceived by Rainer von Leoprechting and Ria Baeck in Brussels/Belgium.
