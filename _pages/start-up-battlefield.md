Some 30 companies, chosen from hundreds of applicants, launch their products on the Disrupt stage before a live and online audience in front of a panel of expert judges. After the demos, pitches and a tough round of questions, TechCrunchâ€™s editors, working with the VCs, seasoned entrepreneurs, and product experts, select six companies for a final, drama-filled round on the third and final day of Disrupt. Only one Battlefield contender can take home a $50,000 check and the coveted Disrupt Cup.
