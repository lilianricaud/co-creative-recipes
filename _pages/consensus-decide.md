Consensus decide is a group decide process that not only seeks the agreement of most participants, but also the resolution or mitigation of minority objections and concerns. Consensus may be defined professionally as an acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the "favourite" of each individual. Consensus decide is thus concerned with the process of deliberating and finalizing a decision, and the social and political effects of using this process.
