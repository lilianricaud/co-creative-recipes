Wiki Loves Monuments is an international photo contest for monuments, organized by Wikimedia, the movement behind Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia – a global collaboration authored by volunteers. The contest is used as way to encourage volunteers to contributes photos and articles.

The contest is inspired by the successful 2010 pilot in the Netherlands, which resulted in 12,500 freely licensed images of monuments that can now be used in Wikipedia and by anybody for any purpose. The 2012 contest in 35 countries resulted in more than 350,000 images submitted by over 15,000 participants, adding to the sum of all human knowledge gathered on Wikipedia.

Any support is welcome: from uploading a single image, spreading the word about the contest, to becoming a partner or sponsor.
