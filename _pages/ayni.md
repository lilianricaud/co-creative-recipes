<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayni" target="_blank">Ayni</a> is a term with a meaning that’s closely related to [minga][1]. It describes a system of work and family reciprocity among members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayllu" target="_blank">ayllu</a> (a community working on collective land). It is commonly exemplified in the sharing of tasks such as agriculture, shepherding, cooking or house construction. The tradition is still alive, not only in many peasant communities, but among the mestizo populations of Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile. Any Time Bank or hours exchange system, such as those of the Spanish 15M movement, could, in essence, be described as an ayni.   Related: [Minga][1], [Barn Raising][2], [Gadugi][3], [Meitheal][4], [Talkoot][5], [Dugnad][6], [Naffīr][7], [Gotong-royong][8], [Bayanihan][9], [Imece][10], [Harambee][11],
