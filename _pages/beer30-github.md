Beer:30 id GitHub’s name for the weekly two-hour show that is part staff gabfest, part TED talk.

Every friday at 4:30, it’s beer and fun and catch up time in the Cafe, the company’s pool-table-and-video-game-flanked meeting place. GitHub opens the phones at designated times to allow anyone to call in and ask the founders questions. Post recordings of talks given at GitHub.
