Though not officially recognised as a micronation, the festival – formerly Sunrise Celebration – aims to adhere to the main principles of a micronation, operating as open a democratic model as possible and providing the chance for anyone to raise issues, discuss the playctioning of the nation and collectively decide what it will become. Participants will get a passport on arrival and will get stamps for participation to activities, this passport may be used at future festivals and yield special benefits.
