This is an activity for energising a conference at the start, or can also be carried out at key points during the conference and even at the end.

The idea is to give a short, opening speech, a "welcome" to the conference. This lasts for 2-3 minutes. The difference is that it isn't one person who gives this speech but everyone, together - at the same time!

It plays with improvisation and resonance and can be breathtaking sometimes, at other times play and motivating.

It works with very large groups. Even 500 people!
