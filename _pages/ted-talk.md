Inspiring speakers are chosen to talk in front of an audience for 5 to 18 minutes. Videos are shot and broadcasted on the TED website. TED talk are typically crowd-translated via the Open Translation Project with subtitles added to promote knowledge sharing.

The format comes originally from TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design), a global set of conferences owned by the private non-profit Sapling Foundation, under the slogan "ideas worth spreading".

TEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by anyone who obtains a free license from TED, agreeing to follow certain principles. TEDx events are non-profit, but may use an admission fee or commercial sponsorship to cover costs. Similarly, speakers are not paid. They must also relinquish the copyrights to their materials, which TED may edit and distribute under a Creative Commons license.
