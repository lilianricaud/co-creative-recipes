In computing, BoF (birds of a feather) can refer to: An informal discussion group. Unlike special interest groups or working groups, BoFs are informal and often formed in an ad-hoc manner. The acronym is used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to denote initial meetings of members interested in a particular issue. A BoF session, an informal meeting at conferences, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda.
