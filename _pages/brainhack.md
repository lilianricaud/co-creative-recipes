Brainhack is a 3 days event that builds from the concepts of an unconference and hackathon with
Participants interested in neuroimaging from any discipline (e.g., mathematics, computer science, engineering, neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, neurology, medicine, art, etc…). 

Each of the next three days begins with an “Ignite Session” in which distinguished neuroscience researchers give 15 minute talks that address wide questions in neuroscience that would benefit from open, interdisciplinary collaborations.

The “Ignite Session” is followed by a “hack session” and a dynamic set of talks organized by attendees. During the “hack sessions”, participants are encouraged to work together in small groups on relevant neuroscience projects. The workshop culminate on the last day, when participants have the opportunity to present a brief overview of their project.
