Foo Camp is an annual hacker event hosted by publisher O'Reilly Media. O'Reilly describes it as "the wiki of conferences" or un conference

Some have described it as a meta-birds-of-a-feather session[citation needed] that gets smart people together to discuss technology issues. This style of event has also been described as an unconference.[citation needed]
