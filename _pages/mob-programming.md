A format where a group gather physically with one person manipulating the computer connected to a video projector, and works for the group that collectivelly discuss the choices.

Mob Programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming, where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on the same code at the same time. However Mob Programming extends the collaboration to everyone on the team while still using a single computer for writing the code and doing other work.

Here are some ideas that have worked well:
• Size of team: 4 or 5 people
• Attendance and participation are voluntary
• Arrange a physical setup that is comfortable, simple to put
together and use
• Follow the Driver/Navigator model
• Use a rotation time of 4 or 5 minutes
• Work on an exercise
• Do it weekly: for 2-3 hours, or daily for 1-2 hours
• Invite anyone who is interested
• Try to show Kindness, Consideration, and Respect
• Hold a short retrospective after each session
