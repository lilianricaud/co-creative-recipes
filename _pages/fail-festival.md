Fail Festival is a celebration of failure as a mark of leadership, innovate, and risk-taking in pushing the boundaries of what is possible in scaling ideas from pilots to global programs. Failure is the f-word of international development. Unspoken in polite company, but a reality in our work. We're often in market failure environments, so who are we to expect success 100% of the time? That's why its time for Fail Festival 2013. There is great value in examining our mistakes and learn from failure as we go beyond the easy and the simple. Audience participation is not only encouraged, it is mandatory.
