A distributed fair to support artists where people can support artists by paying artists debt.  The artists will be present at the fair to discuss their work and their economic lives. When a collector wants to support an artistâ€™s work through real interact, they write a check directly to the loaning bank in exchange for art. We encourage offerings of work at many levels from small Kickstarter give-like amounts to help spread the love, to pieces that trade for complete debt bailouts.
