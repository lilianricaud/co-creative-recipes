* Not to be confused with back to back meetings, Back-against-back discussions is a discussion format where two participants are sitting or standing leaning their back against the other person's back whenever a discussion heats up and a dispute over something need to resolve.* Most of the time, in the heat of arguing, it's in our human nature to try to always win an argument, being completely rational or irrational. Same things happens to most of us on relationship discussions. By doing this back-against-back thing, you continue the discussion as if you were still arguing face to face. After a couple of minutes, this helps to end the discussion and have a really happy outcome. This way of discussing helps to learn about yourselves and each other by doing this. What happens is that the arguing becomes significantly more objective. You no longer have another person in front of you that you're trying to rationalize, apologize, persuade or convince about something, instead, you're more vulnerable because you're talking to nobody in front of you. Your voice resonates and you can pretty much listen to your own voice and think, "Well, I do have a point!" or maybe, "Damn, I'm full of shit, this is wrong. I am wrong."It used to take a couple of minutes to end th discussion for good. At the end, when you turn around, you get to face the person that you just agreed with. It's a moment where you go 'ah.. There she is...' Or 'there he is...' And realize how beautiful a peaceful moment feels.It's a little thing that changed our relationship.
