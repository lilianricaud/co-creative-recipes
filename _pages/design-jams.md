Design Jams are one-or-two-day design sessions, during which people team up to tackle engaging User Experience (UX) challenges. Similar to developer ‘hackdays’ they aim to get designers together to learn and collaborate with each other while working on actual problems. The sessions champion open-source thinking & share and are non-profit, run by local volunteers.
