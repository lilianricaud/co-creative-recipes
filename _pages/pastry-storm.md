 Pieing is the act of throwing a pie at a person or people. This can be a political act when the target is an authority figure, politician, or celebrity and can be used as a means of protesting against the target's political beliefs, or against perceived arrogance or vanity. Perpetrators generally regard the act as a form of ridicule to embarrass and humiliate the victim. Pionneered by belgian Noel Godin, pastry storm is the act of "pieing", ie plant a cream pie on the face someone people he feels that is particularly self-important and lacking a sense of humor. His followers take care to look as ridiculous as possible as they throw their tarts, smiling broadly, spouting anti-pretentious poetry and repeating "gloup, gloup, gloup." This act is way to attack powerful people in a non violent way.
