A playful self-organized cooking session using food waste and music.

Typically dicarded food is collected from markets and co-cooked by participants in a playful atmosphere (with a band or DJ playing music, hence the "disco" soupe). This event can be used to cook for a large group, raise awareness about food waste and usually the food produced is shared with homeless people.

The fun "disco" name has been inspired creative posters and flyers to promote the event.
