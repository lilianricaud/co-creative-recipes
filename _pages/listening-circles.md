This form of dialogue is inspired by Native American councils. It is practiced with many names and variations -- talking stick circle, wisdom circle, council process, and others. I call it listening circle because of its trademark quality of listening -- a deep listening to one's deepest self, to the group mind and to Spirit, as well as to each other. We can even listen deeply when we are talking: we can be aware of the words we are saying as we say them, of the way our bodies feel, of the stream of semi-formed thoughts and emotions out of which our words are coming, and of the receptive group space into which we are sending them.

Imagine now that we are doing a listening circle. You and I and a number of friends are seated in a circle. We tell a few newcomers what to expect. When we are all clear on what will be happening, our circle starts. We sit in silence. A stick (or some other holdable object) sits in the middle of our circle. A woman who feels moved to speak picks up the stick. She holds it as she speaks, and we all listen to what she says. No one speaks unless they have the stick. We engage in no cross-talk or conversation in the usual sense. When the speaker is done, she passes the stick to the man on her left who ponders it for a moment before speaking. After a few minutes he passes the stick to the person on his left and so it goes. The stick continues around the circle, with each of us speaking in turn and the rest of us listening. When our scheduled circle time is up -- or when we pass the stick around the whole circle with none of us speaking -- the stick is returned to the center and our circle is done.
