 A Hackathon for education, bringing in educators and leaders in the education space and building connections between the education sector and the heart of the tech sector with partners such as Code for America.
Participants – including developers, data analysts, designers and education partners – will form teams and hack for 48 hours to develop apps and analyses addressing real problems/challenges in the education sector.
Participants will choose a challenge outlined by one of our education partner organizations, and create a solution (an app or analysis) to be evaluated by a panel of judges.
