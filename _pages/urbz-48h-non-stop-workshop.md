Some neighborhoods are around the clock non-stop, phenomena. Playing or working residents and “users” have no time to lose. 48h non-stop workshops harness this restless, perpetually-in-motion energy, where people become willing  to dive in a creative exercise with full intensity, in a context where they would otherwise be unable to take 4 or 5 days off of their routine.
The 48h non-stop workshop format is inspired by ‘hackers events’ such as Yahoo!’s Hack U and Open Hack where talented young programmers get access to previously unknown codes and have 48h to develop new application prototypes. It is also inspired by architecture school’s design charrettes where collaborators just push themselves to the maximum to produce a final output.
