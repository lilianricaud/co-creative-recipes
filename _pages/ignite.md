Ignite is a global event, organized by volunteers, where participants are given five minutes to speak about their ideas and personal or professional passions, accompanied by 20 slides.

Each slide is displayed for 15 seconds, and slides are automatically advanced. The Ignite format is similar to <a title="Pecha Kucha" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/pecha-kucha/">Pecha Kucha</a>, which features 20 slides displayed for 20 seconds each and belongs to the family of <a title="Lightning Talk" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/lightning-talk/">Lightning Talks</a>. The presentations are meant to "ignite" the audience on a subject, i.e. to generate awareness and to stimulate thought and act on the subjects presented, in that sense they share similarity to <a title="TED talk" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/ted-talk/">TED talks</a>.
