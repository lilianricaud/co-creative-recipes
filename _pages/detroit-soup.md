Micro granting dinner playding creative projects. Detroit SOUP is a monthly dinner that provides micro-playds for creative projects in Detroit. For $5, attendees receive “soup, salad and a vote,” as they put it. During the dinner, four entrepreneurs have 4 minutes each to pitch a business idea that would benefit the city of Detroit. The dinner guests vote on the most deserving projects and the playds from the night go towards the winner.
