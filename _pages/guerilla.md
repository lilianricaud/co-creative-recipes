Guerrilla warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which a small group of combatants such as armed civilians or irregulars use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit-and-run tactics, and extraordinary mobility to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional army. The use of the diminutive evokes the differences in number, scale, and scope between the guerrilla army and a formal, professional army. Co-creative communities have used this concept to describe some of their acts where small loosely organized groups take act.
