People need feedback to get better at their work. But, all too often, feedback misses the mark because it's too vague to be useful. Constructive feedback is information-specific, issue-focused, and based on observations.

It can be described through 8 principles :
1. Feedback is given on observable behaviors, which that person has had (very important!) and not on someone or on interpretations. Observations have a far more factual and nonjudgmental aspect than do interpretations. Most feedback starting with “YOU should...” is unlikely to be inclusive of the other person’s feelings and needs! Instead, feedback must be given on the specific cause, that is, the behaviors which have led to a situation. By doing so, feedback has a far more factual and nonjudgemental aspect and is not perceived as an evaluation.
2. Be direct when delivering your message (avoid beating around the bush)
3. Avoid "need to" phrases, which send implied messages that something that didn't go well (Providing clarity on what occurred is the aim of feedback).
4. Be sincere (you mean what you say with care and respect) and avoid giving mixed messages (yes but)
5. Give the feedback person-to-person, not through messengers of technology or in groups
6. First share your feelings and then your concerns
1. First, indicate to what extent the behavior of the other person has fulfilled or not) one's own needs and the feelings they have triggered. That step is really important : talk about oneself , rather than about the other person. Feedback will consequently be given without a sense of moralization and critics.
2.second, directly after, express concern (negative feedback) or appreciation (positive feedback). The purpose of negative feedback is to create awareness that can lead to correction or improvement in performance. If you can't give negative feedback in a helpful manner, in the language and tone of concern, you defeat its purpose. The purpose of positive feedback is to reinforce performant characteristics of the person.
7. Finish by a clear ask. The objective at the end is really to maintain an empathic relationship.  Starting with clear observable facts, and expressing our feelings and unfulfilled needs, feedback should end up with a specific ask. An ask could be as simple as “How did you receive / do you feel about what I just said ?"
