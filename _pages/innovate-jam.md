Jamming is a high-energy, high-engagement, highly productive working technique which is becoming more important in innovate processes.  Working to tight or “impossible” deadlines and with a strong emphasis on "doing, not talking", participants are invited to think with their hands, and decide by building. The outputs of a Jam are not just ideas, but prototypes of services, products or initiatives. Jam seems to be very similar to hackathons and are hard to distinguish.
