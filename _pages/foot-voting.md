Foot voting is the ability of people to "vote with their feet" by leaving situations they do not like or going to situations they believe to be more beneficial. This process is used in various participative formats such as barcamp or hackathon, where participants are encouraged to pick up their belongings and move to the table or room where the person/topic/project they like best and that they want to work on, is.
