Launch48 is an event where participants aim to create and launch a web application in 48 hours. 

Developpers and people from various background gathers. The weekend starts on friday night, after a day-long conference where mentors and experts covered various subjects such as legal 101 for startups, digital PR, marketing and social media.  Soonafter everyone has a chance to pitch his own idea, in front of the other attendees with 6 making it to the final round of voting.

Each participant can pick the idea he like the most, and join the team. the each group works hard to launch a web. This can be very challenging as people mostly don't know each other and each group has to find his balance and split tasks amongst them. 

By the end of the weekend each group should have build a prototype with interesting business plans and marketing strategies.
