A method to get an overall feedback from a crowd/mob. 4 or more microphones are passed around in the crowd. Each person holding a mike says ONE word before passing it to someone else. If the crowd take the rythm, the words flow in a regular rythme from the crowd and give feeling of the crowd's opinion, feeling in direct way and a very short time.
