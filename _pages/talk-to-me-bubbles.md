A simple technique to facilitate meaningful conservations between participants in an events by making it easy to visualize participants interests.

While some online system of tag like seat&amp;meet or #mousTIC can do the trick, this low tech version works everywhere. Initially the paper bubbles were stucked on laptops, but it was hacked and participants stick them on their back. There’s something about sticking pieces of paper and writing to your chest that just works. It’s slightly ridiculous (which breaks through any “serious” energy, which is a barrier to discussion) and it’s blatantly communicative. You can say what you want.
