Hackfit is a fitness-infused startup competition for innovative thinkers passionate about healthy living. Following the traditional three-day hackathon formula, Hackfit ups the ante with camaraderie-building fitness challenges, rockstar mentorship, and superfoods – challenging teams to create the future of health, fitness, and sport technology.

Hackfit is built on the ethos and understanding that technology development and a healthy lifestyle do not have to be mutually exclusive.

The goal is to unite coders, students, and athletes to develop fitness and health related hacks, interspersing work with play by participating in exercise classes such as rock climbing, yoga, CrossFit, martial arts, running and more – healthy food included. Not only do Hackfitters live a healthy lifestyle, they make the world a healthier place as well.
