<em>This is a small serie of questions to start a meeting and have people share a little of themselves to break the ice and start bonding.</em>

each individual goes around the table and shares the following:
<ul>
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Rose.</strong> Something that’s going really well.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bud.</strong> Something new in your life that you don’t know how it’s going to, but that has potential and is at a crossroads.</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Thorn.</strong> Something that’s causing you pain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
