An online meeting format for collective thinking and peer mentoring.

Every week for four weeks, six social entrepreneurs from all over the world connected online spent 90 minutes together discussing their projects. Each week, three people would present, and the others would listen and provide feedback. Presentations are 30 minutes and consist of three parts:

10 minutes of presentation
10 minutes of feedback, where the presenter can only listen, not respond
10 minutes of synthesis from the presenter
