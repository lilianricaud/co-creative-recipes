a one-day festival where anyone could open a restaurant anywhere (from living rooms to public plazas). Restaurant Day is a food carnival created by thousands of people organizing and visiting one-day restaurants worldwide. The idea of the day is to have play, share new food experiences and enjoy our common living environments together. The event is facilitated by a team of volunteers who also maintain this website. All restaurateurs are personally responsible for all acts related to running their restaurants.
