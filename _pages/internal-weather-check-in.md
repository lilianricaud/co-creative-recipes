Internal Weather Check-In is a simple <a title="Check In / Check Out" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/check-in-check-out/">check-in</a> to start a meeting and get focussed as a group.

At the start of a meeting, every participant is asked how he feels and feel, and express that as weather (sunny, cloudy, ...)

How people are feeling can actually be <em>essential</em> information for conducting a good meeting. If someone is feeling tired, sick or overwhelmed, it is important to mention it during check-ins. Here’s a story that emphasizes this point:
<blockquote>Recently on the second day of two-day-long leadership team meeting I was facilitating, an executive chose <strong><em>not</em></strong> to say in the check-in that he had been up since 3 am with a toothache. So his clinched jaw, contorted facial muscles, and sharp speech were interpreted by many of his peers as, “He’s not happy with where this conversation is going.  He’s angry.” Obviously those interpretations had an impact on the meeting, and not a good one. Had he mentioned in the check-in that he was exhausted and in pain, his peers and boss could have interpreted his non-verbal behavior more accurately. Though such vulnerable shares can be hard for more private people, and especially leaders, they can be essential to truly productive meetings. In this case, a  private conversation with me during the break helped him shift his state to engage more constructively in the last half of the morning. source: <a href="http://groupaya.net/a-simple-tool-for-better-meetings/">http://groupaya.net/a-simple-tool-for-better-meetings/</a></blockquote>
By asking How is your internal weather? Is it clear and sunny?" the person would focus automatically on his or her feelings, and might say something like, "It is not clear and sunny, um, it's cloudy, and it may start to rain." It is a simple but <a title="Powerful transformative questions" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/powerful-transformative-questions/">powerful question</a> because even people who are shy or have difficulties getting in touch with their feelings can respond to the question. It also allow people to decide without constraint how much they want to share about their personal feeling with others.

By allowing people to express their feeling and state of mind they can "leave their luggage" (whatever emotions or thoughts they carry) at the entrance of the meeting. Being allowed to express themselves and admit they might be tired or stressed, they can be part of the meeting more mindfully.

This simple check-in works well during <a href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/tag/online/">online meeting</a>
