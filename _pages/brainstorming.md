The term Brainstorming has become a commonly used word in the English language as a generic term for creative thinking. The basis of Brainstorming is a generating ideas in a group situation based on the principle of suspending judgement - a principle which scientific research has proved to be highly productive in individual effort as well as group effort. The generation phase is separate from the judgement phase of thinking.
There are many variants of Brainstorming, although the basic rules are the same.
