a summer “camp” experience that brings together students, parents, educators, and business and community leaders to develop themeselves in the field of system thinking, sustainability & education. The format includes learn journeys to experience “systems-in-act”, special guest “provocateurs” and facilitators who will challenge and push participants in how they think about education, project market place, pecha kucha sessions and graphic recording.
