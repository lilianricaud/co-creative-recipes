Worldwork is a small and large group Process Work method that uses Deep Democracy to address the issues of groups and organizations of all kinds. To resolve reality problems and enrich community experience, Worldwork methods focus on finding and employing the power of an organization’s or city’s dreamlike background (e.g. projections, gossip, roles, and creative fantasy). Worldwork facilitators listen to the land, do innerwork, practise outer communication skills involving role consciousness, signal and rank awareness to enrich organizational life. Worldwork has been successfully applied to the analysis of, and work with multicultural and multileveled groups, Aboriginal communities, universities, small and large international organizations, city hot spots, in corporations and world conflict zones.

Deep Democracy is the principle behind a community building process that hears all voices and roles, including our collective experiences of altered states, and subtle feelings and tendencies. It is a principle that makes space for the separable, the barely speakable and the unspeakable.

Process-oriented psychology (process psychology, process work, POP, dreambody work) is a cutting-edge therapeutic method created in the 1970s by Dr Arnold Mindell, an American therapist of the Jungian school, and a team working under him.

Process work is a modern method of psychological work with people in various states of consciousness. In his original process-oriented psychological theory Arnold Mindell combines concepts from various sources: Taoist philosophy, Jungian analytic psychology, the theory of information, the theory of roles, the communicative approach and system approach in therapy. Different currents and inspirations are combined in one simple and coherent theory of process.

Process Work represents a phenomenological current in therapy. A process-oriented therapist studies the subjective world of others, helping them find patterns and hidden meaning in a seemingly orderless world of experience and the problems of the daily life, dreams, body symptoms, relationships and altered states of consciousness. In working with couples, a family or a group, an important task of the therapist is getting to know the ways in which they describe their reality, i.e. their problems. Process work uses various therapeutic techniques enabling work both with verbal material as well as through movement or body experience. The process-oriented therapist’s work includes elements reminiscent of the interventions of a gestalt therapist, techniques used by Jungian analysts, elements of psychodrama and also methods used in the behavioural-cognitive therapy. Process-oriented work is a successful synthesis of various therapeutic techniques preserving its own internal cohesion. It refers to the basic concept of process and its terms are taken from the theory of information.

Worldwork is also an experiential training seminar in conflict work and community building that takes place usually every 2 years. The seminar provides a unique opportunity for people from all over the world to come together in a powerful forum for focusing on and working with social, environmental, and political issues using group process skills. Between two and three hundred people from over thirty countries participate in these 6 day gatherings. The large staff team facilitates a diversity of learning experiences that include large group focus and interaction, small group meetings, one-to-one sessions and networking groups.
