Start up week end are 54-hours events where developers, designers, marketers, product managers and start up enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products and launch startups.

On a Friday night, attendees meet up for the first time and pitch their ideas for startups, eventually breaking into groups. For the remainder of the weekend, the groups work to bring their idea to life, wrapping up with a pitch contest at the end of night on Sunday.

Every event is operated semi-autonomously, with all aspects of the event being planned and executed by a team of local Organizers. A small, full-time Events team provides ongoing support to each Eventâ€™s Organizing Team throughout the event planning process, from systems management, advice on best practices facilitating connections, and more.
