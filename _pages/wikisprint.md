Sprint means “a short race at top speed”, and in open source universe it refers to a collective programming methodology that occurs during a short period of time. This methodology is frequently used in the Python community (an open source programming language) and has been adapted to collective book writing, which are known as Book Sprints.
A WikiSprint is an event for collaborative produce of content that is done intensively in a short period of time and takes place on a wiki platform.
