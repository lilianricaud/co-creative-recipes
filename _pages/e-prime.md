<b>E-Prime</b> (short for <b>English-Prime</b>, sometimes denoted <b>É</b> or <b>E′</b>) is a prescriptive version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb <i>to be</i>. E-Prime does not allow the conjugations of <i>to be</i>—<i>be</i>, <i>am</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>was</i>, <i>were</i>, <i>been</i>, <i>being</i>— the archaic forms of <i>to be</i> (e.g. <i>art</i>, <i>wast</i>, <i>wert</i>), or the contractions of <i>to be</i>—'s, 'm, 're (e.g. <i>I'm</i>, <i>he's</i>, <i>she's</i>, <i>they're</i>).

Some scholars advocate using E-Prime as <strong>a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing</strong>.

For example, the sentence "the film was good" could not be expressed under the rules of E-Prime, and the speaker might instead say "I liked the film" or "the film made me laugh". <strong>The E-Prime versions communicate the speaker's experience rather than judgment, making it harder for the writer or reader to confuse opinion with fact.</strong>
