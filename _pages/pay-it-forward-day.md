Inspired by the movie ‘Pay it Forward’ starring Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt, Pay it Forward Day involves people performing random acts of kindness for others without expecting anything in return. Instead, recipients are instructed to ‘pay the kindness forward’ to others in need, essentially creating a positive ripple effect of giving.
