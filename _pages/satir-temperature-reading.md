Temperature Readings can facilitate congruent communication and assists individuals in
becoming more open. Temperature readings work well for
• Discussing that which is human in all of us and hardly ever gets talked about
directly
• Making human contact with (new) members in a group
• Facilitating connection and bonding between group members
• Making the covert more overt
• Assessing emotional climate
• Demonstrating individual and group processes are valued
• Detoxifying and transforming toxic situations early
• Transforming closed systems in open systems
• Maintaining open systems
• Raise self-esteem
• Changing rules, values and patterns of communication
In general, Temperature Readings legitimize our whole human being, and supports healthy
group processes.
<h3>Appreciations and Excitements</h3>
Honoring our humanness with appreciations and excitements, no matter how small, creates
connections and feedback of a higher order. Usually appreciations go from general to more
specific to provide communication with clarity, for example:
Marc, I would like to appreciate you for reviewing this handout on temperature
readings. I think your review comments have improved its readability, and I
now feel much more comfortable putting it out there.
<h3>
Complaints with recommendations for change</h3>
Some people have inner rules that say “Don’t complain”. When we are restrained by inner
rules, we need to learn how to handle complaints, conflicts, and differences in “more
positive” ways or else these inner rules lead to destructive downward spirals.
As facilitators, we support restating “negative” statements to “positive” statements by not
seeking who is to blame or taking corrective actions. People putting a complaint on the
table in this section of a temperature reading, have usually studied a problem deeply. We
validate hearing “it” and look beyond the “complaint” where we can find descriptions of
“how things are now” and a desire for “how things are hoped for to become different”.
Such restatements open up space for generating solutions. When we request and honor
complaints, it may provide people with more freedom to raise complaints, facilitating
healthy change.
<h3>Puzzles, Gossip and Rumors</h3>
This part of a temperature reading creates room for exploration and clarification, and to
enhance understanding of individual and group situations and events. Anxiety can take a
seat, and we can cocreate common understanding and address real concerns of those
involved.
It may surprise the reader, but this I would call the hardest part of a temperature reading
to facilitate, in terms of congruence and authenticity.
Facilitator: Are there any puzzles, rumors or gossip?
Member of group: I am puzzled about my role. I got these new business cards stating I’m a
systems architect, and I’m not sure what changes in my responsibilities that brings, what
the role entails and which resources I can use to do what it is a system architect does.
Facilitator: I can understand you need to find out about these things in order to
effectively play the part. How might you begin to find out?
<h3>
New Information</h3>
Create a specific space for new information, so people can receive and share information
they may not find the right time for otherwise. When one item is given, often more new
information follows.
As a facilitator, you can use this section to to keep discussions and items in other sections
focused. Redirect items to "new information" by asking someone to hold until this part of
the temperature reading comes up.
<h3>
Hopes and Wishes</h3>
A wide room with many views, where we dream and visualize how we imagine our future.
Bringing these into awareness is important for honoring individuals and groups and moving
towards fulfillment of our dreams. Verbalizing our dreams is a first step towards
actualization of our hopes and wishes and can makes our (common) goals seem more
obtainable.
