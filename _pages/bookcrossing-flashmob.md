The BookCrossing principle is to label the book and drop it in a public space, and go away so the next person just finds a book. The book's travel can be followed via the Bookcrossing.com website that provide label. A bookcrossing flash mob is a large scale gathering of Bookcrossers releasing books simultaneously.  But BookCrossers being booklovers most hang around to see books other people left so it becomes a meeting place.
