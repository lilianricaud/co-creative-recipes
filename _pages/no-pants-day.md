No Pants Day is a participatory holiday that happens on the first Friday in May in United States of America. The holiday is based on the premise of having people spend their day not wearing any pants (trousers). Participants are challenged to act as if there is nothing strange about not wearing pants in public. The liberation of breaking a social taboo and seeing the react of people not aware of the event generally makes the event play for its participants.
