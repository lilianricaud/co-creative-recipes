A story map is a visual depiction of the settings or the sequence of major events and acts of story characters. This procedure enables participants to relate story events and to perceive structure in literary selections. By share personal interpretations of stories through illustrations, participants increase their understanding and appreciation of selections. Story maps can be used as frameworks for storytelling or retelling, and as outlines for story writing.
