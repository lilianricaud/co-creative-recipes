<b>C-K design theory</b> or <b>concept-knowledge theory</b> is both a <a title="Design" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design">design</a> theory and a <a title="Theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory">theory</a> of reasoning in design. It defines design reasoning as a <a title="Mathematical logic" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic">logic</a> of expansion processes, <i>i.e.</i> a logic that organizes the generation of unknown objects. The theory builds on several traditions of design theory, including <a class="new" title="Systematic design (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Systematic_design&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">systematic design</a>, <a title="Axiomatic design" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_design">axiomatic design</a>, <a title="Creativity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">creativity</a> theories, general and formal <a title="Design" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design#Design_approaches_and_methods">design theories</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-FDT_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-K_Theory#cite_note-FDT-1">[1]</a></sup> and <a title="Artificial intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>-based design models. Claims made for C-K design theory include that it is the first design theory that:
<ol>
	<li>Offers a comprehensive formalization of design that is independent of any design domain or object</li>
	<li>Explains invention, creation, and discovery within the same framework and as design processes.</li>
</ol>
The name of the theory is based on its central premises: the distinction between two spaces:
<ul>
	<li>a space of concepts <b>C</b></li>
	<li>a space of knowledge <b>K</b>.</li>
</ul>
The process of <a title="Design" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design">design</a> is defined as a <i>double expansion</i> of the C and K spaces through the application of four types of operators: C→C, C→K, K→C, K→K
