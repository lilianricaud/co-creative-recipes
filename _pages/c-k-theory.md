**C-K design theory** or **concept-knowledge theory** is both a [design][1] theory and a [theory][2] of reasoning in design. It defines design reasoning as a [logic][3] of expansion processes, *i.e.* a logic that organizes the generation of unknown objects. The theory builds on several traditions of design theory, including <a class="new" title="Systematic design (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Systematic_design&action=edit&redlink=1">systematic design</a>, [axiomatic design][4], [creativity][5] theories, general and formal [design theories][6],<sup id="cite_ref-FDT_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-K_Theory#cite_note-FDT-1">[1]</a></sup> and [artificial intelligence][7]-based design models. Claims made for C-K design theory include that it is the first design theory that: 
1.  Offers a comprehensive formalization of design that is independent of any design domain or object
2.  Explains invention, creation, and discovery within the same framework and as design processes. The name of the theory is based on its central premises: the distinction between two spaces: 

*   a space of concepts **C**
*   a space of knowledge **K**. The process of 

[design][1] is defined as a *double expansion* of the C and K spaces through the application of four types of operators: C→C, C→K, K→C, K→K
