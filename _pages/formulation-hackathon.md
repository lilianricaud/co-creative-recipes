When people move into working groups, they will be tempted to jump right in and start working on the project.  Formulation is a stage where people spend some time thinking about and developing the idea itself before diving into working on it. Once your attendees move into groups itâ€™s a good idea to encourage them to spend some time thinking and rethinking the proposed idea, now that there are more people involved.  This is also when they can split up the work so that everyone has something to do and the project progresses as quickly as possible. They can work on whiteboards or on paper as a team to develop the idea for an hour or so.
