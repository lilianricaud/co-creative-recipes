An event for hacker whose medium us art and artists whose medium is technology.

Sixty artists-hackers and hacker-artists inhabit an art space to create an exhibit from scratch during 48h. It starts on a Thursday evening with a meet &amp; greet and provide good food, fast Internet, and equipment for collaborating on and creating new work. On Saturday evening participants transition from hackspace to exhibition hall and the projects are shown to the public during a flash exhibit (open to the public just one evening). There are no demos but plenty of performances. Depending on location, 500-1,000 visitors come to the opening with &gt;10,000 uniques online.
