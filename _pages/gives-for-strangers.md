a worldwide annual day to spread kindness and goodwill around the world. Because one little act of kindness can inspire others to act, and change the very way someone sees the world make or buy cheap gives, specifically items which you think would  make someone smile. It could be something you create, like visual art, a  poem, or a song you write. Or a something you owned or purchased for  relatively cheap, like a yo-yo, teddy bear, or a good book. Just remember, be creative, and make it personal!
Wrap each present individually! Along with each give, we ask you to  write a personal card. Write a heart-felt message. Something honest and open. And make sure to include “From one stranger to another, Happy Holidays”.
One should never underestimate the power of kindness. It can create a smile or a laugh from thin air. It can change a person’s opinion or even their view on  life. Like a flame, kindness can spread from one person to another. Changing the world, as if by storm. And like magic, it always manages to make its way back to you.
