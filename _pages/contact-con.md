Contact is a working festival of innovate where the net's leading minds and entrepreneurs can connect with the people who are building the social technologies of tomorrow. The event uses various formats, such as "provocations" short talks intended to spur participants thinking, teach them the latest concepts in net development interactive sessions,  "Baazar" a marketplace of demo stations, convened sessions. The event also has a competitive element with participants voting on the three or four that they really want to see move forward in some fashion and then convene one more meeting slot to develop next steps for realizing these ideas.
