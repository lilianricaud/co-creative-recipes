The learn circle is a mechanism for organizing and honoring the collective wisdom of the group and is present in many indigenous cultures. For example, in early native councils of elders came together to understand problems in a spirit of shared community in “wisdom circles.” The term learn Circle has been used to describe group efforts with clear links to social change . Over time and across countries, civic organizations, neighborhood communities, trade unions, churches and social justice groups have used the idea of learn circles to empower their members to make choices and take act.
