<b>U-procedure and Theory U</b> is a change management method to change unproductive patterns of behavior.  It has been used in organization development and social development since that time. The method has also been explicitly developed to handle to the consciousness and process issues associated with relational dynamics and conflict resolution

Theory U proposes that the quality of the results that we create in any kind of social system is a function of the quality of awareness, attention, or consciousness that the participants in the system operate from.

Since it emerged around 2006, Theory U has come to be understood in three primary ways: first as a framework; second, as a method for leading profound change; and third, as a way of being - connecting to the more authentic of higher aspects of our self.
