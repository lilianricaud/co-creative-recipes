* A list of tools on the web to help organize your meetings online and offline.*   <h2 id=":3to" class="hP" tabindex="-1">
  UnHangout - A platform for unconferen<wbr />ces. On the web.
</h2> Unhangout is an open source platform for running large scale online un-conferences. We use Google Hangouts to create as many small sessions as needed, and help users find others with shared interests. Think of it as a classroom with an infinite number of breakout sessions. Each event has a landing page, which we call the lobby. When participants arrive, they can see who else is there and chat with each other. The hosts can do a video welcome and introduction that gets streamed into the lobby. Participants then break out into smaller sessions (up to 10 people per session) for in-depth conversations, peer-to-peer learning, and collaboration on projects. UnHangouts are community-based learning instead of top-down information transfer. -

## Flashmeeting Flashmeeting is an online video conferencing tools with several specificities that help shape the interact. Noticeably, only one person can talk at a time, forcing all th other participants to listen until their turn. In a sense this is similar to the Talking Stick principle. Another important aspect is the limitation of time of the conference to 1h30 maximum, after that time the call is shut down so the meeting cannot be extended and has to end.
