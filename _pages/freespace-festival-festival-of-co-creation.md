An afternoon of activities, workshops and people following the freespace philosophy – the people make the festival.  A space for art, project prototypes, open discussion, workshops, music, demonstrates, food, swap-meets, skillshares… a melting pot with the best that Adelaide has to offer.

Bring a project – or just bring your friends and participate in what others are offering.
