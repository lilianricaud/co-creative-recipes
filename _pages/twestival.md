A Twestival (or Twitter-Festival) is a global movement which uses the power of social media to organize offline events that mobilize communities in support of a local cause. Twestival was born out of the idea that if communities were able to collaborate on an international scale, but working from a local level, it could have a spectacular impact.

Since 2009, over 200 cities have participated in Twestival, raising $1.75 million for over 275 important causes like clean water and education. Twestival events are coordinated 100% by volunteers and 100% of the playds raised through ticket sales and donations go directly to support charitable projects.
