Small procedure for discussions. Click: “simple and stupid, therefore effective” - if you don’t understand something say “click” to step out of your role, ask for an explanation, then say “unclick” (ie. interrupt and “return from interrupt”). When coaching in pairs, coaches can “click” to ask what the other coach is doing.
Rewind: ask to have the last few sentences, or questions “struck from the record”. To change or remove something you wish you had not said, or to change your mind.
