Open Foresight projects start off by drawing on well-established methodologies from the Futures Studies field, as well as principles from design thinking to create a framework for building forecasts and scenarios. The next step is to tap into the opinions of domain experts as well as the wisdom of crowds to generate an array of perspectives and viewpoints. Finally, we combine those patterns and insights into rich visual media that can be viewed, shared, discussed, and repurposed.

By clarifying the visions of how society may evolve and what our interacts and behaviors would look like, we begin to understand the steps we can take today to move towards the most desirable futures.
