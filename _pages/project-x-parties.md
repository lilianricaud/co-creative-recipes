Project X is a 2012 comedy film dabout three friends who plan to gain popularity by throwing a party, a plan which quickly escalates out of their control. Following the release of Project X, many parties were inspired by the film.

Projet X parties are characterized by:
- social network viral promotion, 
- systematic video capture 
- organizers search for fame 
- strong alcool and drug use
- huge and dense crowd
- destructions and chaotic crowd behavior 

Interesting in the sense of an example of anti-pattern (not co-creative, but rather co-destructive).
