The URBZ MASHUP workshop facilitates creative explorations and cultural exchanges between cities and people.
Dreams, myths and personal stories influence the destiny of cities as much as political choices and economic opportunities. They inspire architects and artists, stimulate activists and residents, and broaden the vision of the public and decision-makers.
This workshop provides a space of expression for practicioners in architecture, planning, design, art, media, creative writing and other creative fields. It is based on the idea that the best way to make genuine breakthroughs in the way we understand, experience and create our cities is to stimulate collective imagination, by bringing together people from all over the world and all ways of life. The workshop provides a space to produce new images, narratives and insights about cities and urban life, using online tools, digital technology, personal experiences and professional skills.
