A protest where participants bang on pots and pans. Sometimes a manif casserole sounds like random banging, but a rhythm usually arises from the chaos, encircling the disorder and enveloping everyone. Participants can march on the street or bang from their homes.
The casseroles transcend differences that often structure local politics–like language, class, and race–as well as gender and age, which can present barriers in music-making (especially drumming) in addition to politics. Because the instruments are simple, cheap and improvised, almost anyone can join. Because the music is deliberately non-professional, the ideals of mastery and perfection and the weighty gendered and aged assumptions about who can be a “good musician” are inoperative. The beats are easy to pick up and play in time—and if you swing a little out there, all the better.
