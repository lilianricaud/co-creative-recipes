An online meeting format for collective thinking and peer mentoring.

This format is inspired by <a title="Project Kitchen Meetings" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/project-kitchen-meetings/">Project Kitchen Meetings</a>, a peer mentoring round robin set up with 6 people over the course of 4 weeks with each person discussing a challenge they faced and then taking a turn to get feedback on their unique challenge.

Online Mini Think Tank examine a new angle on that, a place where people might have similar enough challenges that would share solutions but their different perspectives would be interesting and generative.
