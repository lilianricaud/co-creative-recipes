Switch On Switch Off is a workshop on the basics of digital interact in the physical world, for beginners and pros, people from all ages and background. Participants hack their bodies and their environment, turning them into the switches that activate and inactivate simple electronic circuits. A team of artists and designers guide them as they try and invent creative interactive gestures. The main idea is to keep it simple â€”  not simplistic. More advanced practitioners can also get a lot from the simplicity of the workshop, being able to quickly iterate and try things. The constraint of  a very simple building block is in fact liberating, as you concentrate on the gestures and the scenario.
