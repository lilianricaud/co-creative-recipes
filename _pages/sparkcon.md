SPARKcon is an interdisciplinary creativity, art & design festival. SPARKconâ€™s put together by passionate individuals who volunteer their expertise and are deeply embedded in a specific local scene. Using a combination of network and open calls for participants, organizers create diverse and representative events to show off local talent and connect disparate creative scenes.

SPARKcon is comprised of multiple areas of interest, referred to as SPARKs. Some examples are musicSPARK, artSPARK, circusSPARK, and fashionSPARK. Each SPARK is independently organized by volunteers who are typically already embedded in a local community of interest.
