The chaordic path is the path that walks between chaos and order. Too much chaos results in wasted energy and little progress. Too much order can stifle creativity and a nimble responsiveness to dynamic situations or opportunities. When we don't know or are not sure where we are going, or what we can do to best serve the future, we can bring useful form to our work by working with clear steps. These steps are intended to create generative structures that allow us to be most effective in the stages of our work without stifling creativity, the emergence of new ideas and new ways of doing things. Each of these steps is activated by asking key questions. As we design our work together we can select from these questions (or design others) to help us explore each stone as we lay it in place. The steps themselves are key inquiries we need to remain if we want to lead in and navigate through change. This approach is used in [Art of Hosting][1], and asks [Powerful transformative questions][2]
