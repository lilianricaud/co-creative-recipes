A <b>flash mob</b> (or <b>flashmob</b>) is a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual and seemingly pointless act for a brief time, then quickly disperse, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, and artistic expression. Flash mobs are organized via <a title="Telecommunication" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication">telecommunications</a>, <a title="Social media" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a>, or <a title="Viral email" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_email">viral emails</a>.

The term, coined in 2003, is generally not applied to events and performances organized for the purposes of politics (such as protests), <a class="mw-redirect" title="Commercial advertisement" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_advertisement">commercial advertisement</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Publicity stunts" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_stunts">publicity stunts</a> that involve <a class="mw-redirect" title="Public relation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relation">public relation</a> firms, or paid professionals.
