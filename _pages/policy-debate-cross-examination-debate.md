Policy debate is a form of debate competition in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution. It is also referred to as cross-examination debate because of the 3-minute questioning period following each constructive speech. Affirmative teams generally present a plan as a proposal for implementation of the resolution. The negative will generally prove that it would be better not to do the plan or that the opportunity costs to the plan are so great that it should not be implemented.
