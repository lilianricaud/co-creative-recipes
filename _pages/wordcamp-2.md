WordCamp is a community-organized conference centered on the WordPress publishing platform. These events are organized, paid for, and attended by the local WordPress communities in accordance with guidelines published at <a href="http://www.wordcamp.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WordCamp.org</a> and the principles of the WordPress Foundation. The first WordCamp was held in San Francisco in 2006, and each subsequent year has brought growth in the number of cities in which it is organized. As of 2010, there have been WordCamps on every continent except Antarctica.

WordCamps should be attended by everyone who uses WordPress, and everyone who should use WordPress. This category includes bloggers, designers, developers, authors, marketers, SEOs, Businesses, Non-profits, photographers, realtors, consultants, entrepreneurs, etc.

The content of WordCamp presentations are highly focused on using or developing on WordPress. Issues around blogging, business, and social media that are related to WordPress use may be included. While WordCamps are not big, fancy, expensive conferences, the material shared is highly valuable.
