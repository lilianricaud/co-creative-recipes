Inquiry-based learn (also enquiry-based learn) describes approaches to learn that are based on the investigation of questions, scenarios or problems - often assisted by a facilitator. Inquirers will identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learn includes problem-based learn, and is generally used in small scale investigations and projects, as well as research.
