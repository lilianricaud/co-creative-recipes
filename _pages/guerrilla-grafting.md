A variant of guerilla gardening where  groups of Guerrilla Grafters secretly graft fruit-bearing scions onto ornamental, non-fruiting trees in street of cities.

The streets of many cities are lined with pear, plum and apple trees, but out of fear that the fruit would make a mess and attract rodents, the city intentionally plant sterile trees that don’t bear fruit. By grafting fruit-bearing branches on those trees, Guerrilla Grafters make fruit free and accessible to anyone who picks it.

To graft a branch onto a fruit tree, all you have to do is make a slit with a knife in a brach on the host tree; insert a branch from a fruit-bearing tree, and secure it with tape. “Once it heals, it connects,”

With “undoing civilization one branch at a time” as their motto, Guerrilla Grafters consider what they do to be a radical act — and it is. Although it doesn’t solve problems of food scarcity, it’s a symbolic move towards making fresh food free and accessible to all
