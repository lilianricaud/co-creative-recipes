Silent Disco Squad brings the transformational power of the dancefloor into everyday moments by organizing public, participantÂ­ driven Danceparties. Using mp3 players, smartphones, and headphones, all SDS participants hear the same music at the same time, transforming everyday moments into a Silent Disco Squad.

&nbsp;

Silent Disco Squad in 3 Steps!
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>1. Join your Local Silent Disco Squad party.</li>
	<li>2. Suggest your currently - favourite superhawt dance track for the mix. The mix is crowdsourced. Choose a song that makes you groove!</li>
	<li>3. <strong>BYOD (Bring your own device):</strong> Bring your mp3 player, smartphone, walkman with the downloaded mixed uploaded and of course: your headphones!</li>
</ul>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><strong>On safety</strong>
Walking as a group all wearing headphones can be dangerous, especially when crossing roads - we are a collective, watch out for your SDS brothers and sisters!</li>
	<li><strong>Ethos</strong>
While there is an SDS organizer, the organizers create (and curates) the space. Everyone is an active participant.</li>
</ul>
