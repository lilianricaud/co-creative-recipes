PlayThink is a celebration of Art, Sustainability, Music, Performance, FLOW, and Life itself. The PlayThink Movement is an inclusive, participatory, community and family oriented culture of vitality, fun, and well-being, rooted in the belief that each of us has the power to re-shape our own experience mentally and physically to live life to the fullest.

The PlayThink Festival offers an atmosphere of magic, letting you experience dance parties, circus camp, and four full days of play just for you and yours. Inspiring playshops, presentations, and discussions will be led by some of the best known flow arts regional instructors. Musicians, Dancers, Artists, and Lovers of Life will converge in Berea, Kentucky with their full range of unique talents offering a wide range of life enhancing skills and thoughts.
