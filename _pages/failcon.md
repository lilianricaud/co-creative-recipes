FailCon is a one-day conference for technology entrepreneurs, investors, developers and designers to study their own and others' failures and prepare for success. FailCon is a "closed" event, for profit and under heavy licencing (3 years, with 15% licencing fee on events, branded material) but might inspire an OpenFailCon.
