<strong><em>Inspired by the four freedoms of free software, Open social innovation aims to document social innovation practices as “free/libre recipes” to make them visible, usable, copyable, and improvable.<!--more--></em></strong>
<h2>Open Social Innovation and free/libre recipes</h2>
Open social innovation propose to describe/document social innovation practices in the form of a <a title="Free/Libre Recipes" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/freelibre-recipes/"><strong>free/libre recipes</strong></a> inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms_(Free_software)#Definition">the four freedoms of free software</a>.

The free/libre recipes , “source code” of our social innovation are an implementation of the will to share, mutualize, spread and improve the “how-to” of our initiatives

Like cooking recipes, we try to describe the how-to, the ingredients, the tools, and what gets produced. By sharing recipes with others, we can improve our the recipes together or create local variants.

Like free/libre software we are in a spirit of sharing:
<ul>
	<li><strong>show/make visible</strong>: no fabrication secret, the recipe is conceived to be seen and used by as many people as possible</li>
	<li><strong>allow reuse</strong>: document the tips, tricks, the difficulties to facilitate reuse</li>
	<li><strong>allow copy</strong>: the recipe is published under a free licence to allow the largest diffusion</li>
	<li><strong>improve the recipe</strong>: by trials, local adaptation, the recipes gets refined, adapted to places, cultural contexts</li>
</ul>
Social practices have already been documented and shared in the past. However open social innovation provides a new conceptual framework to implement at large scale the will to share, mutualize, spread and improve the “how-to” of the best social initiatives for <a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Thrivability">thrivability</a>.

More about <em><strong>Open social innovation,</strong> </em>as a new intellectual framework to facilitate the sharing of social practices.
