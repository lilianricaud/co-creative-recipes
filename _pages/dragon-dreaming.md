Dragon Dreaming is a training methodology based upon the principles of personal and group empowerment. Drawing upon the insights and experience of Living Systems Theory, Deep Ecology, Transpersonal Psychology, group dynamics, and organizational development, and from indigenous Third and Fourth World cultures and applying them to government agencies, business enterprises, local or personal projects and not for profit community organizations, Dragon Dreaming uncovers the blockages that limit the effectiveness of groups of people who may be working together to achieve a common task. These factors which limit effectiveness produce specific symptoms which provide methods of diagnosis which may be personal, theoretical, environmental or practical, and when they are discovered, can be overcome through greater awareness, lateral creative thinking, correct implementation, and/or acquisition of appropriate skills.
