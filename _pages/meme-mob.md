A group of people get together to do a performance, usually linked to a internet meme and records of video of it. It's a distributed mob, ie usually involves individuals but also groups, yet it is mob in the sense everyone joins around a common purpose, the meme, even tough everyone might not participate at the same time or in the same place. Usually involve copy, parody, remix. Example Gangnam style, Harlem Shake. Meme mobs mostly happen for play but have been used as political tools to demonstrate in a play and new way (ex: Harlem shake Mob by egyptian activists)
