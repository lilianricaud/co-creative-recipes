Simple technique for discussion, Used a lot in improv, Instead of saying “yes but…” say “yes and…” This creates a different dynamic in the conversation. Brings a more positive attitude, Brings ideas to the conversation, Makes improvements, solves problems, vs creating new problems
“Yes, and…” makes me stop and think and be more positive… it helps me keep the conversation moving forward
