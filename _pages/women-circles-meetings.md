Women gather together for a variety of reasons. Support groups, ritual circles, discussion forums, gatherings that nurture creativity - all are ways in which women create community, banish isolation, and empower themselves. Women's circles provide safe and nuturing spaces for participants to own their feelings and experiences, to take creative risks, and to allow their deepest yearnings to take root and blossom.
