A group of musicians gathering unexpectedly in a public space to play music, suprise people and invite them to join in the singing/dancing.

This flash mob can be organised for political purposes or simply to surprise people, hack the routine and bring smile on people's face.

Variants include Orchestra (less participative), Sirtakis Flash Mob. Likely inspired by <a href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/improv-everywhere-missions/" rel="bookmark">Improv Everywhere Missions</a>.
