<strong>Community Laughter Clubs</strong> are a worldwide network of social clubs run by volunteers where like-minded people get together just to laugh as a form of exercise. They do so in a variety of public places or indoor venues.

This is not a trademark. <strong>Community Laughter Clubs</strong> are 100% independent. They do not report nor receive orders from anybody and do not pay royalties.

<strong>Community Laughter Clubs</strong> all over the world adhere to a common code of conduct: they are not for profit, non political and non religious. All are welcome.

Anybody and everybody can start and run a <strong>Community Laughter Club</strong>.

<strong>Community Laughter Clubs</strong> are part of a worldwide grassroots social movement. They are not intended as a commercial project.

<strong>Laughter Clubs</strong> were initiated by Indian physician Madan Kataria, who writes about the practice in his 2002 book <i>Laugh For No Reason</i> and started Laughter Yoga.

<b>Laughter yoga</b> (<i>Hasyayoga</i>) is a practice involving prolonged voluntary laughter. Laughter yoga is based on the belief that voluntary laughter provides the same physiological and psychological benefits as spontaneous laughter. Laughter yoga is done in groups, with eye contact and playfulness between participants. Forced laughter soon turns into real and contagious laughter.
