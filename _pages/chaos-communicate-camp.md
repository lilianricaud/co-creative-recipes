The Chaos communicate Camp is an international meeting of hackers that takes place every four years, organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC).

The camp is an event for providing information about technical and societal issues, such as privacy, freedom of information and data security. Hosted speeches are held in big tents and conducted in English as well as German. Each participant may pitch a tent and connect to a fast internet connection and power.
