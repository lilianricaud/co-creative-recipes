Bodystorming is a technique sometimes used in interact design or as a creativity technique. The idea is to imagine what it would be like if the product existed, and act as though it exists, ideally in the place it would be used. The proponents of this idea like to point out the fact that you get up and move, trying things out with your own body, rather than just sitting around a meeting table. The most common critique seems to be that it is not really a proper user-centred method, since it is more often carried out by the designers than the users of the final product. Christopher Alexander used a similar technique to walk through places with users in order to visualize how building where going to look like and how users would interact with them
