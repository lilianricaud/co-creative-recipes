Web services that enable broadband-connected learners to communicate in real time via audio, video, slides, whiteboards, chat, and screen-sharing enable learning groups to add some of the audio-visual dimensions familiar from synchronous face-to-face communication to otherwise asynchronous platforms such as forums, blogs, and wikis. This article includes resources for finding and evaluating appropriate for-free or for-fee platforms, tips on participative activities for real-time meetings, and suggestions for blending real-time and asynchronous media.

In the nine online courses I have facilitated, the emphasis on co-learning encouraged participants to suggest and shape active roles during real-time meetings. By creating and taking on roles, and shifting from role to role, participants engage in a kind of collective learning about collective learning which can be as pleasurable as well as useful. Typically we first brainstorm, then analyze, then organize and present the knowledge that we discover, construct, and ultimately convey together.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Searchers:</strong> search the web for references mentioned during the session and other resources relevant to the discussion, and publish the URLs in the text chat</li>
	<li><strong>Contextualizers:</strong> add two or three sentences of contextual description for each URL</li>
	<li><strong>Summarizers:</strong> note main points made through text chat.</li>
	<li><strong>Lexicographers:</strong> identify and collaboratively define words and phrases on a wiki page.</li>
	<li><strong>Mappers:</strong> keep track of top level and secondary level categories and help the group mindmapping exercise at the end of the session.</li>
	<li><strong>Curators:</strong> compile the summaries, links to the lexicon and mindmaps, contextualized resources, on a single wiki page.</li>
	<li><strong>Emergent Agendas:</strong> using the whiteboard for anonymous nomination and preference polling for agenda items, with voice, video, and text-chat channels for discussing nominations, a group can quickly set its own agenda for the real-time session.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-paragogical-action-review">The Paragogical Action Review</h2>
Charlie Danoff and Joe Corneli slightly modified the US Army’s “After Action Review” into a technique for evaluating peer learning as it happens.  The five steps in the “PAR” are:
<ol>
	<li>Review what was supposed to happen</li>
	<li>Establish what is happening</li>
	<li>Determine what’s right and wrong with what we are doing</li>
	<li>What did we learn or change?</li>
	<li>What else should we change going forward?</li>
</ol>
Participants can run through these steps during live meetings to reassess the medium, the readings, the group dynamics, or any other choices that have learning relevance. The focus in the PAR is on change: as such, it provides a simple way to help implement the “double loop learning” described Chris Argris [1].
