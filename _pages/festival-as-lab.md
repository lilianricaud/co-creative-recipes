<em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Festival As Lab and the Festival As Lab Toolkit (FALT) are a method and set of tools for developing living lab research projects and for a new kind of relationship between a festival and its partners and host city.</span></em>

Festival as Lab is a living lab method.

A city-wide festival can transform a city into a playspace by enabling artists and designers to play with the DNA of a city.

Festivals can be agile RnD environments for real-world rapid prototyping, open innovation and user-led design. They are participatory spaces that nurture play, risk and community creation. Festivals are intermediaries between global creative communities, stakeholders and local citizens. They can be tuned to experiment not only in artistic content but in technology prototyping and city development.

What is a Living Lab?

Living labs involve open innovation in real-world environments. They take research out of the laboratory to test ideas and prototypes with participants in real-life situations. This goes beyond simply testing with users by involving users in co-creation, experimentation and evaluation. The method emerged out of computer science and an early advocate was William Mitchell at MIT.

Why festivals?

Cultural festivals can support emerging artforms which signpost the art and culture of the future. Festivals involve large numbers of people taking part in experimental, playful activity. They are crucibles where new ways of doing things can emerge. They enable the free circulation of people and ideas, connecting people at different levels, from grass roots to government and business leaders. They offer the ability to discuss and give attention (including media attention) to a topic or experiment.

The goal of <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Festival As Lab Toolkit (FALT)</span> is to:

• Provide the tools for festivals around the world to act as living labs
• Enable creative communities to drive open innovation
• Stimulate new RND in art, media, technology and city development
• Create intermediaries between policy, technology research, citizens and the arts
