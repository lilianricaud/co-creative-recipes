RoleStorming is an evolution of Brainstorming, whereby you take on another identity. It was developed by Griggs (1985) and described by VanGundy (1988). Viewing problems and solutions from a different standpoint. Unusual ‘off the wall’ ideas may seem radical/’silly’ if ‘you’ present them, however, generated by a nameless person removes any embarrassment.
