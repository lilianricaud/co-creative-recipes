National Day of Civic Hacking is a national event taking place in cities across the US. The event brings together citizens, software developers, and entrepreneurs from all over the nation to collaboratively create, build, and invent new solutions using publicly-released data, code and technology to solve challenges relevant to our neighborhoods, our cities, our states and our country.National Day of Civic Hacking will not be the same type of event in each city. Depending on the local needs of your community, it might be a block party, hackathon, brigade meetup - or something else entirely.
