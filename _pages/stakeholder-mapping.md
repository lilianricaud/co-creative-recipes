Beyond the processes and technologies, at the heart of it, collaboration is made possible by how we see people, how we treat them and how we involve them in an initiative. Collaboration is more productive when we have diversity of ideas and perspectives. <strong>To achieve inclusiveness <em>and</em> diversity, we must identify all of the voices within a system and find a way to involve them</strong> in the initiative or – at the very least – represent their perspective to other stakeholders. But how do you identify all of the diverse voices in a system?

A stakeholder map make sure that all voices would be accounted for and show that everyone has a role.

By indicating the voices needed to answer the main questions of an initiative, this map helps include the stakeholders who represent a whole system and assemble the diversity needed for effective collaboration.

Because the framework is based on the mindset that <strong>everyone has a role,</strong> it enables us to more appropriately value the differing perspective that each stakeholder brings. The acknowledgement that all of these perspectives are necessary to achieve success helps set a tone of mutual respect – and collaboration is not possible when we do not respect and value individual differences. Ideals are important, and pragmatism is important as well.

The map indicates that stakeholders will be involved appropriately in an initiative: some will be involved intensely; some will be involved less intensely. Without mandating collaboration, the map helps to set up an environment for an initiative where stakeholders with diverse perspectives can build respect and learn to work together.
