Interactive online discussion between a distributed audience and a guest speaker.

A Twangout integrates the dialogue of Twitter with the live video stream from Google Hangout. While the audience questions are on Twitter (using a hashtag for the event), the answers are given through a live video where the moderator asks questions and interview the guest speaker using questions from twitter audience.

Both twitter and video stream are integrated on one platform.
