Scrapathon, is creating with scrap.

We often don’t have the time, space and materials to play with our children at home and this sort of activity gives parents and children an opportunity to play and learn together. The interact between Dads and their children is as amazing as the monsters and space ships that are created. Run as part of the North Wiltshire Festival and at St. Peter's School during Family learn Weekend children and their families have created puppet theatres, rockets, dolls house furniture and boats all  from scrap materials. Parents experience teaching children and children teach the  parents!  They learn about physics, music and  art.  They use all their senses.  Children and adults learn to  make mistakes, hold back, hint and nudge, stimulate and support each others ideas. They have a go.  They  become resilient learners together.

Workshops can be run as a single event or as part of a larger family learn event.
