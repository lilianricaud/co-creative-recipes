A potlatch is a give-giving festival and primary economic system practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of Canada and United States.

A potlatch was held on the occasion of births, deaths, adoptions, weddings, and other major events. Typically the potlatch was practiced more in the winter seasons as historically the warmer months were for procuring wealth for the family, clan, or village, then coming home and sharing that with neighbors and friends.
