<strong>An annual, global event to raise awareness</strong> and <strong>start conversations </strong>about the benefits of economies based on sharing, as well as offer a <em>liberating experience </em>to inspire more<em> critical </em>and <em>creative </em>thinking about our relationships with money and how we can have <em>new types of economic activity.</em>

<strong>.</strong> On September 15, people hand out their own money to complete strangers (two coins/notes at a time) asking the recipients to pass half on to someone else.
