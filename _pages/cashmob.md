A cash mob is where you and people nearby meet up and buy something at a local store helping you make friends, reconnect with people in your local community and give local business the support they need. Cash mobs are a great way to boost local business and bring community together while you’re at it. The idea is simple: a group of people flood a store and pledge to buy stuff. Think flash mob but instead of dancing, you’re spending money to help give back to the local economy.
