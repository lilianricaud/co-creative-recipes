Forest Calls are a weekly conference call, where inspiring change makers engage in candid conversations about their journey.

The format of the call is: opening with a minute of silence to ground participants presence to the call, followed by 20 minute open-mic "Circle of Sharing" around the week's theme, and then a conversation with the guest speaker -- moderated by one person During the last 20-25 minutes of the call, callers will have the chance to ask the guest speaker questions directly and engage in a dynamic Q&amp;A around the emergent themes.

The basic idea is really to share, hold space, learn from each other, and help co-create the call.
