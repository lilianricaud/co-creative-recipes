<p style="text-align: justify;">A collaborative format for efficient online meeting inspired by the <a title="Pomodoro Technique" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/pomodoro-technique/">Pomodoro technique</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Format:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">invite everyone by announcing the meeting format (45 minutes interaction, 10 min break, 45 minutes interaction) and set up a pad for collaborative writing where people can co-create the list of topics for the meeting</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">you can use this technique in meatspace or online using a videochat tool such as skype or google hangout.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">at the beginning of the meeting, start a timer for 45 minutes</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Start the meeting by a <a title="Powerful transformative questions" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/powerful-transformative-questions/">powerful question</a> such as <a title="Internal Weather Check-In" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/internal-weather-check-in/">Internal weather check-in</a> to allow people to release their "internal luggages" before they tune in the meeting</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">start working</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">when the timer ends, everyone has to take a break and close the videochat, no matter how interesting was the work/discussion. People can have water, coffee, go to the loo, have a cigarette, take a small walk</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">after the break everyone comes back and the timer is set for another 45 minutes.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">5 minutes before the end, the person setting the timer should announce the time and participants should list thing to get done, next steps and next meeting day or time.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">when time ends everyone say good bye and goes</li>
</ul>
This format use the time constraint to prevent endless meeting. It is longer than the pomodoro technique time because when working as a group it takes longer to get in the topic. The break is to allow us to take care of our body instead of sitting hypotized in front of the computer (particularly important for online meetings).
