Hacknights are project time, an open house, jam space and brainstorming session all rolled into one. The event occurs at night so people who have another day kob can attend. Hacknight is an opportunity to connect, share ideas and launch new ventures in the community. Itâ€™s a great time to come work on a side project or pursue a hobby.
