A network event organized as a walking meeting with a facilitator. this format helps make the network less formal and encourage creative thinking

Each walk the facilitator works in collaboration with different a  business woman or man to bring a slightly different flavour or hue.

All of the walks are lightly facilitated with a particular theme depending on the time of year and the collaboration.  Woven into the walk there is both time for reflecting on different aspects of the business in addition to network.

In terms of actual numbers, this again may vary between location and collaboration, however currently we walk with no less than 6 netwalkers including us, and up to 20.
