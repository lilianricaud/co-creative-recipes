Soundpainting is the live composition using a sign language 
 for musicians, dancers, actors, poets, and visual artists. At present, 
the Soundpainting language comprises more than 1200 gestures that are 
signed by the composer/director, known as the Soundpainter, indicating 
the type of material desired of the performers. Direction of the 
composition is gained through the parameters of each set of signed 
gestures
