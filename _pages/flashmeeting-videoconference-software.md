Flashmeeting is videoconference software that allow several participants to discuss with audio and video capabilities. However compared to other videoconference or videochats tools, it has several characteristics that shape the group interactions:
<ul>
	<li>only one person can speak at a time and participants have to queue before the can speak, therefore it works like "talking piece", helping slow down the conversation, letting the speaker gather is thoughts without being interrupted and forcing everyone to listen</li>
	<li>the meeting opens and close at a specific time, forcing participants to start and finish on time</li>
	<li>the chat provides a backchannel to allow participants interactions</li>
	<li>The meeting can be recorded and allow visualization of much time every participants spoke, giving the group a mirror image of its interaction</li>
</ul>
