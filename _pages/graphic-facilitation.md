Graphic Facilitation is the use of large scale imagery to lead groups and individuals towards a goal. The method is used in various processes such as meetings, seminars, workshops and conferences. This visual process is conducted by a Graphic Facilitator.

The early field of Graphic Facilitation was named “Explicit Group Memory” by Facilitator Geoff Ball, who “discovered” that a shared picture supported group learn or more importantly – a lasting memory in the group.
