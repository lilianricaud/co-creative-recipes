In the Hackathon pitching phase, you invite participants to stand up at their tables one by one and share their idea with the room.  Remind them that the purpose is to introduce their idea so that they can attract other people to work on their idea with them (hence, the name of this component of the hackathon ‘pitching’).  They don’t have to end up working on that idea for the day, but they should pitch it in such a way that others get the value of their idea, and are inspired.
