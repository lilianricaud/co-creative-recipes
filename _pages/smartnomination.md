SmartNomination is a positive and creative version of <b>neck nomination</b>, an online drinking game.The original parameters of the game require the participant to film themselves drinking a pint of an alcoholic beverage, usually beer, in one gulp and upload the footage to the web (usually Facebook). The participant then nominates two others to do the same, although a third nomination has become commonplace. The nominated person has to complete the task within 24 hours.

Neck Nomination became popular in early 2014, and as it spread it escalated, with nominees performing the challenge in more extreme circumstances, drinking more potent beverages or engaging in dangerous activities either during or immediately after consuming their beverage. The British tabloid newspaper <i>Metro</i> reported that at least five deaths in the United Kingdom and Ireland are believed to have been directly linked to the drinking game.

SmartNomination use the same principles of challenging peers and filming yourself but for a positive action such as giving food to homeless people, or giving blood ("BloodNomination"), distributing poems, ...

This format is interesting in the sense it use challenges and social pressure to induce people to take action. However this can be used in silly and dangerous ways (as in necknomination) or positive/creative way such as SmartNomination.

SmartNomination is interesting as it also seems to have manage to break the virality of the neknominate antipattern, helping people under peer pressure to change the rules of the game toward positive outcome.
