DataDives are weekend events that bring the data science community together with the non-profit community to tackle tough data problems in a just a short period of time. Â They promote learning about new skills and methods in data science, bring talented data scientists to the table with social organizations and knowledge experts, and yield truly amazing results from just a weekend.

DataDives to bring together expert analysts with social-sector organisations that have data in order to look for trends and insights. Modelled on a hackathon, where activity takes place over an intense day or weekend of work, DataDives can generate new findings, new ideas about hwo to use data, and new networks for the local authority to draw upon.

Unlike a hackathon where the focus is often on developing a technical app or innovation and where programme skill is often a pre-requisite, a Data Dive might be based around answering a particular question, or around finding what data means to multi-disciplinary teams.
