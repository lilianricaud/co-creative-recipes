Burning Man is an annual art event and temporary community based on radical self expression and self-reliance in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada.

Because of the variety of goals fostered by participatory attendees, known as "Burners," Burning Man does not have a single focus. Features of the event are subject to the participants and include community, artwork, absurdity, decommodification, and revelry. Participation is encouraged.

The Burning Man event and its affiliated communities are guided by ten principles that are meant to evoke the cultural ethos that has emerged from the event. They were originally written by Larry Harvey in 2004 as guidelines for regional organizing, then later became a universal criterion of the general culture of the multifaceted movement.

They are:
<ul>
	<li>radical inclusion,</li>
	<li>gifting,</li>
	<li>decommodification,</li>
	<li>radical self-reliance,</li>
	<li>radical self-expression,</li>
	<li>communal effort,</li>
	<li>civic responsibility,</li>
	<li>leaving no trace,</li>
	<li>participation,</li>
	<li>immediacy.</li>
</ul>
