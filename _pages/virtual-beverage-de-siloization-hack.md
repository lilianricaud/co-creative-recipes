A three people online meeting to share a drink and chat. Can be used on any large social platform/online community.

Pick two people whom you don't know there and whom you find interesting.Use the platform to publicly call them out and invite them to a virtual coffee using the platform of your choice.

Pick a time that works for the three of you, then open it up so that anyone else who's interested can join.Spend 45 minutes getting to know each other, then reserve the last 15 minutes to brainstorm a followup hack to post back. Share what happened.
