Think speed dating but instead of sitting across from each other at tables, you meet each other in bed — a garden bed, that is.

Lines of men and women face each other across a row of vegetables in need of some TLC. They weed and get to know each other. After a set amount of time, either the men or women move down to the next partner. Depending on the attendance and weeding logistics (and whether the weed dating event is romantic or platonic), many hosts have weeders work in small groups that are broken up and reformed until everyone has met each other.

Weed dating first made an appearance at a Northeast Organic Farming Association <a href="http://nofavt.org/">NOFA Vermont</a> event in 2010 and since then other farmers have organized their own meetups as far away as New Zealand. In addition to providing some volunteer farmhands, the events have been used as fundraisers, neighborhood mixers and outreach for the host farm. Farmers, like participants, are drawn to the somewhat silly nature of the event. It’s catchy and ripe for puns. As for the event itself, there’s very little required besides a turnout and some weeds to pull. (Maybe a little alcohol to loosen participants up afterward.)
