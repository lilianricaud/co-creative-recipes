Open Data Day is a gathering of citizens in cities around the world 
to write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish 
analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the 
adoption of open data policies by the worldâ€™s local, regional and 
national governments.
The events are open to anyone: from curious citizens to journalists, tech-geeks to scientists, designers to data wranglers.
