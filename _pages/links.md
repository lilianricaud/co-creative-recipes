## Group Works

*   The **Group Works** card deck is designed to support your process as a group convenor, planner, facilitator, or participant. The people who developed this deck spent several years pooling our knowledge of the best group events we had ever witnessed. We looked at meetings, conferences, retreats, town halls, and other sessions that give organizations life, solve a longstanding dilemma, get stuck relationships flowing, result in clear decisions with wide support, and make a lasting difference. We also looked at routine, well-run meetings that simply bring people together and get lots of stuff done. The deck consists of 91 full-colour 3.5" x 5.5" cards (plus a few blanks to add your own patterns), a five-panel explanatory insert, and an accompanying booklet explaining the purpose and history of the project and suggesting uses for the cards in group process work.

## Core Protocols for Shared vision

*   The Core Protocols are practices that enable people to aggregate their virtues – and hence starting that aggregation is starting down the path toward greatness. Being great also means dropping behaviors that don’t lead to greatness. Those changes are not easy, but they can be rewarding.

## Change Handbook

*   This book is about effective change. It describes methods for changing “whole systems,”that is, change based on two powerful foundation assumptions: high involvement and a systemic approach to improvement. High involvement means engaging the people in changing their own system.It is systemic because there is a conscious choice to include the people,playctions,and ideas that can affect or be affected by the work.Whole system change methods help you initiate high-leverage, sustainable improvements in organizations or communities. “High-leverage” is emphasized because in any improvement effort,we want the highest possible value for the effort invested.

## LUMA Institute innovate processes

*   Luma Institute has created a framework to help you choose the best tool for each step of the innovate process, based on the people you’re designing for and the complexity of the systems in which you operate.

Each category contains three subcategories, and each subcategory contains four innovate tools. This hierarchical model makes it much easier to identify the tools you need and then put them to use.
