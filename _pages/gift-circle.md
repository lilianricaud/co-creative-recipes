In brief, 10 or 15 people gather in a circle. No one occupies a privileged position – it is a true circle. Participants take turns naming something they would like to give (anyone in the circle can say, “I would like to receive that,” or “I know someone who needs that,” etc.) On the second round, each person names something he or she would like to receive. In this way, the gives and needs of everyone in the group become known, people get used to giving and receiving from each other, and, if the group meets repeatedly over time, a community of mutual reliance develops. People experience abundance – both the joy of giving, and the experience of having their needs met.
