The best advice comes from those who have been there – that is the philosophy behind our weekly brownbag series. Each Wednesday at noon, Gangplank co-working space invites a leader in the local community to share the success they’ve enjoyed, and challenges they’ve faced in their careers. Brownbags occur every Wednesday at noon. A local TED-like format.
