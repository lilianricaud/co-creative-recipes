<span class="s1">The Form storm is a way to boost reciprocal project development and barnraising around initiatives coming out of the community: both individual projects and ones that come out of collaborations between two or more community members.</span>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Funding application processes can be a powerful motivator for helping us get many more initiatives of the ground and driving support for existing ones. Because they motivate us to do the work of putting ideas down in writing. They offer a context and constraints within which we need to define and communicate the details of their implementation. And there is nothing like a deadline to focus attention to get work done. But the work is time consuming and frankly, boring. And if you dont win the competition it can feel like you wasted a lot of time for nothing. So we are building the #formstorm as a new tool to turn the boring, lonely work of crafting funding applications into something that is fun and worth the investment of time regardless of what happens once you hit the “submit” button</span></p>
