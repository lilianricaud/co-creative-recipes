An event around indies books to skip the frenzy of shopping malls and have people buy books directly from the people who author them. The idea is something like a farmer’s market — where the farmer might place his own rutabagas directly into your hands while offering suggestions about how to cook them. “We will make recommendations,” wrote Alexie. “We will practice nepotism and urge readers to buy multiple copies of our friends' books. Maybe you'll sign and sell books of your own in the process. I think the collective results could be mind-boggling (maybe even world-changing).”
