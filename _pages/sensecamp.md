A SenseCamp is a social business ‘unconference’ hosted by MakeSense, bringing together the passionate social entrepreneurs, avid social business enthusiasts and eagerly curious friends. It is a bar-camp style event for about 250 people, promising a full day of inspiring talks, interactive workshops, training and network. A bar camp is a community-driven event where the agenda is mainly set by the participants. 

A SenseCamp is also a unique opportunity to meet the MakeSense community and its members ( the Gangsters), as well as the MakeSense creativity workshop (the Hold-up).
