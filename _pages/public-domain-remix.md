The Public Domain Remix is a partnership challenge run by the Open Knowledge Foundation France and Wikimedia France, aimed at encouraging people to remix public domain works in a creative way. The challenge specifically seeks to promote the use and reuse of public domain works through an interdisciplinary and transmedial approach: rather than following the same medium, people are encouraged to shift from one medium to the other (e.g. remixing a literary work into music, a photograph into a sculpture, etc). The goal is to promote the public domain by showing what can actually be done with it.
