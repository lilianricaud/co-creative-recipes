you are ultimately happier and more successful when you give without expecting a quid pro quo. You are paying it forward. Since behavior is contagious to the third degree, you arenâ€™t simply helping others, in high-impact, five focused minutes of giving. You are also supporting the emotional spread of this practice.

There are many things that can be done in 5 minutes:
<ul>
	<li>give feedback to someone</li>
	<li>Introduce two people,</li>
	<li>promote something or someone</li>
	<li>....</li>
</ul>
