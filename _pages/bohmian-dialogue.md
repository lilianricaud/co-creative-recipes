Bohmian Dialogue (also known as Bohm Dialogue or "Dialogue in the Spirit of David Bohm") is a freely-flowing group conversation in which participants attempt to reach a common understanding, experiencing everyone's point of view fully, equally and nonjudgementally.
This can lead to new and deeper understanding. The purpose is to solve the communication crises that face society and indeed the whole of human nature and consciousness. It is named after physicist David Bohm who originally proposed this form of dialogue.

The Bohmian dialogue is based on four principles:
<ul>
	<li>The group agrees that no group-level decisions will be made in the conversation. This is crucial. Otherwise members are not free. We must have an empty space where we are not obliged to anything, nor to come to any conclusions, nor to say anything or not say anything. It's open and free</li>
	<li>Each individual agrees to suspend judgement in the conversation. (Specifically, if the individual hears an idea he doesn't like, he does not attack that idea.)</li>
	<li>As these individuals "suspend judgement" they also simultaneously are as honest and transparent as possible. (Specifically, if the individual has a "good idea" that he might otherwise hold back from the group because it is too controversial, he will share that idea in this conversation.)</li>
	<li>Individuals in the conversation try to build on other individuals' ideas in the conversation.(The group often comes up with ideas that are far beyond what any of the individuals thought possible
before the conversation began.)</li>
</ul>
