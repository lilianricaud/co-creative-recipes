Appreciative Inquiry is a method that specialize in questions that evoke positive possibilities

Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a collaborative search to identify and understand the organization's strengths, its' potentials, its'
greatest opportunities, and people's highest hopes for the future.

important to the entire group
