act learn is an educational process whereby people work and learn together by tackling real issues and reflecting on their acts. Learners acquire knowledge through actual acts and practice rather than through traditional instruction.

act learn is done in conjunction with others, in small groups called act learn sets. It is proposed as particularly suitable for adults, as it enables each person to reflect on and review the act they have taken and the learn points arising. This should then guide future act and improve performance.
