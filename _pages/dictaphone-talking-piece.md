A way to slow down the pace of discussion within a group (similarly to a Talking Piece) . It's a way to replace
a talking stick/object that might be rejected by a corporate project owner as too artificial and non-professional by an MP3 dictaphone that has to be passed around. This has the happy side-effect of also creating a high-quality recording of the conversation.
