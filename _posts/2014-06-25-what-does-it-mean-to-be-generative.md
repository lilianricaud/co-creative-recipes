Interesting article about the concept of "generativity" and "generative organizations" by Cv Harquail ([@cvharquail][1]). I believe the best co-creative events are temporary "**generative organizations**" allowing emergence of great outcomes, even though we might "*not know and can’t predict specifically what a generative behavior will trigger*".<!--more--> Excerpts: 

> The word ‘generative’ may be unfamiliar to many managers, but the quality of generativity is something we’ve sought in our work practices and systems for a long time. Something is “generative” when it’s able to originate or produce something, or to give rise to new possibilities. Generative ideas produce new ideas, Generative process produces new ways of doing things or new outcomes, Generative learning enhances our ability to create, Generative relationships build new capabilities in both partners, and Generative leadership helps others see opportunity in their actions. Generative practices are important because they make new things possible. They have the capacity for ‘more’ built right in. Generative practices make new opportunities possible, but not inevitable. We don’t know and can’t predict specifically what a generative behavior will trigger. We can only expect these practices to create openings and invite new outcomes to emerge. We also can’t control what others do with the generativity that we put into our behavior towards them. Just as when we invite people to a party and we can’t control if or how they’ll rsvp, we can’t control what people or organizations do with the generative behaviors we extend.   Read the full article: [What’s a Generative Organization?][2].
