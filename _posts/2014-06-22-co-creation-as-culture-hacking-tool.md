Serendipity works beautifully, that's how thanks to Twitter, I stumbled upon <a href="http://wirearchy.com/2013/05/09/co-creating-as-disruption-to-the-dominant-cultural-framework/">Co-Creating as Disruption to the Dominant Cultural Framework</a> a great article from Jon Husband (<a href="https://twitter.com/jonhusband">@jonhusband</a>) which say a lot of thing I wanted to say for a long time.

Excerpts:
<blockquote>Participative processes like Open Space, World Cafes, Unconferences, Peer Circles and so on are beginning to appear in a range of hybrid forms wherever people are meeting and interacting to advance an interest, a topic or subject, a project, etc.

At the same time, in the wide-ranging realms of art and culture-making activities we’re witnessing the advanced stage of a long-term wrestling match between commercial forces and the various main forms of funding the expression of creative endeavours.

The explosions of creative technology we’ve been experiencing have spawned a series of sociological responses, in the form(s) of Barcamps, Wordcamps, Govcamps, Foo Camps, Unconferences, high-end celebrity-and-marketing-and venture-capital ‘experience’ markets, new cultural and artistic festivals with technology-and-culture-making themes. There’s also a rapidly-increasing range of maker faires, many and various configurations of online education (viz. the recent explosion of interest in MOOCs), community-and-consensus building, organizing for activism and fundraising, and other similar events and happenings.

(...)

People are searching for ways to find others with similar interests and motivations so that they can engage in activities that help them learn, find work, grow capabilities and skills, and tackle vexing social and economic problems. As awareness spreads and experience grows, more and more of these types of events and purposeful gatherings occur. Thus, the “get informed and take action” aspects of general culture are strengthened and reinforced, leading to yet more of these types of activities.

Developing familiarity and practice with open and collaborative processes are ways people can prepare for a messy and uncertain (post-normal) future. These processes invite us to play and work together. They occur in spaces in which people can 1) learn more about themselves and the courageous act of finding and using one’s voice, 2) show and see how useful and positive it is to expose and discuss various ideas, 3) demonstrate how effectively they can operate together in a small temporary community of ideas and energy about an issue. It can be seen as “practicing for the future”.

The orientation to open and participative is now regularly taking form in the arenas of education, learning and organizational change. The processes outlined above, and others using the same principles, are cheap, easy for people to apply with a few simple rules about self-management, operate democratically, and produce results grounded in ownership and the responsibilities that have been agreed upon by the ‘community’. The relationships and flows of information can be transferred to online spaces and often benefit from wider connectivity.

Today, our culture-making activities are well engaged in the early stages of cultural mutation. These processes are for these times.</blockquote>

John discusses many interesting points but here are few ideas that particularly caught my attention:

Concept of wirearchy
<blockquote>Wirearchy  is a dynamic two-way flow of power and authority based on knowledge, trust, credibility and a focus on results, enabled by interconnected people and technology.  - Jon Husband (1999)</blockquote>
The six pillars of a philosophical approach called Participative Work Design, created in the 1960′s by Fred Emery (Australia) and Eric Trist (UK, US and Canada)
<blockquote>Participative Work Design – The Six Criteria

1. Adequate elbow room – also known generically as ‘empowerment’
2. Continuous learning – an obvious must
3. An optimal level of variety – conscious avoidance of boredom or meaningless repetition
4. Mutual support and respect – reciprocating, giving and getting help
5. Meaningfulness – a clear sense that what one is doing is useful and aligned with personal values to an appropriate degree
6. A desirable future – people usually don’t want to invest time and energy in dead-end work</blockquote>
And some final toughts:
<blockquote>The dynamics of co-creation are deeply embedded (if not foundational) to P2P activities. The proliferation of cultural festivals and events and happenings at salons, forums, galleries and other venues reflect participative responses to many of the challenges emerging from our growing societal complexity. These events and happenings are where people gather to view, wonder, communicate and explore the infinite ways art and culture stimulate reflection, attraction and the opening of minds and hearts.

(...)

Co-creating in a wide range of forms, processes and purpose may become an effective and important antidote to the spreading enclosure of human creative activity.</blockquote>
