What is our current vocabulary for doing things together ? For example we can "think" or "make" together. But this is fairly imprecise as there are many different ways of thinking or making together. For example when we say we "brainstorm" it implies we think together using a particular format/method (<a title="Brainstorming" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/brainstorming/">brainstorming)</a>. Could it be possible that tomorrow we would say <em>"let's brainsketch"</em>, <em>"let's makestorm"</em>  and have many more precise words to describe our ways of doing things together and communicate our intent ?<!--more-->
<h3>Vocabulary of doing things together</h3>
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/brainstorm?s=t">Dictionnary Reference </a>tells us <em>to brainstorm</em> means
<ul>
	<li> to conduct or practice brainstorming (verb used without object)</li>
	<li>to subject (a problem) to brainstorming (verb used with object)</li>
</ul>
It also tells us that brainstorm means a "brilliant idea, mental excitement, fit of mental application," 1849, and comes from brain + figurative use of storm. As a verb, it has been recorded from 1920s.

The basis of Brainstorming is to generate ideas in a group situation based on the principle of suspending judgement.

So <em>to brainstorm</em> is a specific way of <em>thinking together</em>.

It is interesting to note the brainstorming technique has given birth to many variants: <a title="Brainwriting" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/brainwriting/">Brainwriting</a>, <a title="Brainsketching" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/brainsketching/">Brainsketching</a>, <a title="Bodystorming" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/bodystorming/">Bodystorming</a>, <a title="Makestorming" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/makestorming/">Makestorming</a>, <a title="Dreamstorming" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/dreamstorming/">Dreamstorming</a>, <a title="Gamestorming" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/gamestorming/">Gamestorming</a>, <a title="Artstorming" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/artstorm/">Artstorming</a>, <a title="RoleStorming" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/rolestorming/">Rolestorming</a>...

Just as today we say, <em>"let's brainstorm"</em>, tomorrow we might routinely say  <em>"let's brainsketch"</em>, <em>"let's dreamstorm".</em>

So we can see here that our vocabulary for <em>thinking together</em> can already increased by these variants and having standard free/libre recipes for social practices can helps us enrich our vocabulary of practices.

By extension, it's possible to imagine that nouns describing these various creative meeting formats, could become verbs and tomorrow we might say: "let's <a title="Minga" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/minga/">minga</a>", "let's <a title="Hackathon" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/hackathon/">hackathon</a>", "let's <a title="Permablitz" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/permablitz/">permablitz</a>", "let's <a title="Disco soupe" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/disco-soupe/">disco soup</a>"
<h3>From neologism to dictionnary</h3>
There's a huge difference between a neologism used as an empty buzz word and a living word describing an actual social practice within a community.

The web already has its own slang and there are ressources listing neologisms that are in use on the web (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/">Urban dictionnary</a>, <a href="http://www.wordspy.com/">WordSpy). </a>But how does a word makes it from the margins to a mainstream acceptance and being listed in official dictionnaries ?

In that context it is interesting to see how Google went from being a noun describing a search engine company to a verb meaning "search the web":
<blockquote>The transitive verb to google (also spelled Google) means using the Google search engine to obtain information on something or somebody on the World Wide Web. However, in many dictionaries the verb refers to using any web search engine, such as Yahoo! or Bing. A neologism arising from the popularity and dominance of the eponymous search engine, the American Dialect Society chose it as the "most useful word of 2002." It was added to the Oxford English Dictionary on June 15, 2006, and to the eleventh edition of the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary in July 2006. The first recorded usage of google used as a participle, thus supposing an intransitive verb, was on July 8, 1998, by Google co-founder Larry Page himself, who wrote on a mailing list: "Have fun and keep googling!" Its earliest known use (as a transitive verb) on American television was in the "Help" episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (October 15, 2002), when Willow asked Buffy, "Have you googled her yet?"

So could massive use of new co-creative social practices lead to invention of new verbs of "doing things together" ? This could lead to a self reinforcing loop of more people using the words and the practices behind.

Enriching our Do-it together vocabulary would make it much easier for groups to self organize around such <a title="Co-creative events as “social objects”" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/co-creative-events-as-social-objects/">positive social objects</a> such as <a title="Towards Mutual Aid Flashmobs ?" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/towards-mutual-aid-flashmobs/">mutual aid gatherings
</a>

As the <a href="http://www.lexiconofsustainability.com/">Lexicon of sustainability </a>rightly said:
<blockquote> Words are the building blocks for new ideas. They have the power to activate change and transform societies.</blockquote>
