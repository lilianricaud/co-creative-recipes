[Flashmobs][1] have been used for artistic events or for giant drinks, could they be used for creative and productive action ? That's what Occupy Founder Micah White ([@BeingMicahWhite][2]) believes: 
> Inspired by the success of Occupy Sandy organizing efforts, The After Party also seeks to turn communities into self-sufficient hotbeds of social action. White and the After Party team want to create what they call “mutual aid flash mobs,” citizen gatherings where people can do things like start a time bank, plant urban gardens, fix local roads, organize free healthcare clinics, and build tiny houses for the homeless. via [An Occupy founder says the next revolution will be rural | Grist][3]. One obstacle to this happening is the lack of a shared vocabulary. Having standard recipes of mutual aid type of actions and a common vocabulary to describes these actions would make it much easier for groups to self organize around such [positive social objects][4].
