<a title="Flash Mobs" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/flash-mobs/">Flashmobs</a> have been used for artistic events or for giant drinks, could they be used for creative and productive action ? That's what Occupy Founder Micah White (<a href="https://twitter.com/BeingMicahWhite">@BeingMicahWhite</a>) believes:
<blockquote>Inspired by the success of Occupy Sandy organizing efforts, The After Party also seeks to turn communities into self-sufficient hotbeds of social action. White and the After Party team want to create what they call “mutual aid flash mobs,” citizen gatherings where people can do things like start a time bank, plant urban gardens, fix local roads, organize free healthcare clinics, and build tiny houses for the homeless.

One obstacle to this happening is the lack of a shared vocabulary. Having standard recipes of mutual aid type of actions and a common vocabulary to describes these actions would make it much easier for groups to self organize around such <a title="Co-creative events as “social objects”" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/co-creative-events-as-social-objects/">positive social objects</a>.
