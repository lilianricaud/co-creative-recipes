Discovered via Lyre Calliope (<a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainCalliope">@CaptainCalliope</a>), here's another interesting concept:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_objects">Social Objects</a> which wikipedia defines as objects around which <a class="mw-redirect" title="Social networks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networks">social networks</a> form. <!--more-->

<blockquote>The Social Object, in a nutshell, is the reason two people are talking to each other, as opposed to talking to somebody else. Human beings are social animals. We like to socialize.

I'm thinking Co-creative events can be used as social object, creating their own social network, whether temporarily around a particular gathering, or sometime so successfully they lead to a global event-centered communities (see for example the <a title="Barcamp" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/barcamp/">Barcamp</a> or <a title="PARK(ing) Day" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/parking-day/">Park(ing) Day</a>)
