Discovered via Lyre Calliope ([@CaptainCalliope][1]), here's another interesting concept:  [Social Objects][2] which wikipedia defines as objects around which <a class="mw-redirect" title="Social networks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networks">social networks</a> form. <!--more--> Excerpt from: 

[Social Objects for beginners][3] 
> The Social Object, in a nutshell, is the reason two people are talking to each other, as opposed to talking to somebody else. Human beings are social animals. We like to socialize. But if think about it, there needs to be a reason for it to happen in the first place. That reason, that “node” in the social network, is what we call the Social Object. Read full article: [Social Objects for beginners][3] I'm thinking Co-creative events can be used as social object, creating their own social network, whether temporarily around a particular gathering, or sometime so successfully they lead to a global event-centered communities (see for example the [Barcamp][4] or [Park(ing) Day][5])
