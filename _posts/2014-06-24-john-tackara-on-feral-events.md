In this video, John Tackara (<a class="ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink u-linkComplex js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/johnthackara">@<span class="u-linkComplex-target">johnthackara) </span></a>highlights why we need to have events and meeting formats that are more open and co-creative. To describes these kinds of events he mentions an interesting concept: "**feral events**" 
> Feral gatherings — like an animal that has no longer domesticated — is guided by its context, not by a pre-cooked agenda. A feral event is about this place, this moment, these people. Only here. Only now.<p id="watch-headline-title" class="yt">
