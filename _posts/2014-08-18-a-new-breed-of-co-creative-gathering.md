In opposition to traditional forms of gatherings,  such as meeting, conferences, demonstrations, there has been a growing trend pushing towards more participative and creative formats over the last few years.

From <a title="Barcamp" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/barcamp/">barcamp</a> to <a title="Permablitz" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/permablitz/">permablitz</a>, from <a title="Hackathon" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/hackathon/">hackathon</a> to <a title="Disco soupe" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/disco-soupe/">disco soups</a>, the range and the diversity of new events and meeting formats is wide. However, there seems to be some common characteristics that distinguish these events from more traditional meeting formats.<!--more-->

Co creative events are:
<ul>
	<li>more dynamic and participative than traditional professional meetings</li>
	<li>based on values of openness and sharing</li>
	<li>not <em>organized for</em> but <em>co-organized with</em></li>
	<li>based on people’s interest, passion and willingness to participate</li>
	<li>not trying to eliminate the difference between people but instead feed/strive on individual creativity and diversity</li>
	<li>not very formal – fun or even gaming is built into the event DNA.</li>
	<li>duplicating themselves spontaneously worldwide by bottom/up action, give birth to global communities of practice</li>
</ul>
Although not all co-creative events have these characteristics, overall they seem to be recurrent.
