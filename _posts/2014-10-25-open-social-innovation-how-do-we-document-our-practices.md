The basic idea behind <a title="Open Social Innovation" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/open-social-innovation/">Open Social Innovation</a>, is to document our work and make it available under a free licence so that others can see it, get inspired, copy and improve upon our own practices. One of the main challenge is to document the practices in a way that is easy for the people documenting, but also for the people accessing it.

In that context, <a href="http://shapeshiftstrategies.com/2014/10/05/documenting-our-work-three-simple-guides-to-harvesting/">this article</a> from <a href="http://shapeshiftstrategies.com/">Kathy Jourdain</a>, <a title="AoH (Art of Hosting)" href="http://www.co-creative-recipes.cc/recipes/aoh-art-of-hosting/">Art Of Hosting</a> facilitator is giving a good overview of various possibilities to "harvest" the practices and work as they happen. Here's a little summary.<!--more-->
<h3>Three questions to ask yourself before starting</h3>
Kathy first explains there are three simple guides to consider in documenting your work:
<ul>
	<li>what is the purpose of the harvest ?</li>
	<li>who is the audience or recipient ?</li>
	<li>what are the methods available for you to choose from?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
She first asks some good question about the purpose using a food methaphor.
<ul>
	<li>Is the purpose to consume ?</li>
	<li>keep an ingredient ?</li>
	<li>preserve it?</li>
	<li>or transform it ?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intended audience or recipient</h3>
She then asks about the intended audience or recipient:
<ul>
	<li>Is it for personal harvest?</li>
	<li>To share with a small circle?</li>
	<li>Or to share more broadly ?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Methods of harvest</h3>
She then lists various methods to capture the work:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Documentation</strong>:reports, blog posts, mindmaps, videos, interviews, post-it notes</li>
	<li><strong>Art</strong>: graphic facilitation, photography, table top documentation</li>
	<li><strong>Physical</strong>: body sculptures, movement, dance, skits</li>
	<li><strong>Voice</strong>: poetry, story telling, music/song, voice recording/radio interviews</li>
	<li>using virtual repositories of information, combining the various ways of documenting identified here or emerging in new ways.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A dedicated person or team to harvest</h3>
In Art of Hosting training, harvesting is done by a harvest team that take care of this on behalf of the group. Having someone dedicated to the documentation seems critical as it very difficult forthe people involved to find time to do it while it happens.
